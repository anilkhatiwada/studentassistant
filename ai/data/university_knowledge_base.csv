State Authorization,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: As a regionally accredited public college that participates in federal financial aid programs, Troy University works to ensure that it provides students with accurate and complete regulatory information. This includes documenting compliance with the state laws in any states where educational programming is offered as required by the U.S. Department of Education's program Integrity Rules. Not all states require state specific authorizations and the activities that require authorization vary from state to state. Please direct any questions related to state authorizations to the Coordinator of State Authorizations, Tamara Broadnax. If you are considering an online program that leads to a professional license in a state other than Alabama, it is highly recommended that you contact the appropriate licensing agency in your state to seek information and additional guidance before beginning the program. For licensing board contact information, licensure requirements and program approval status, please see below. The following contact information is for five programs that lead to a professional license. NC-SARA data shows that the vast majority of the programs leading to licensure among participating institutions are in five fields: This resource will NOT house regulations or requirements. It is exclusively general contact information. Professional licensure information for students Students who enroll in a Troy University course who have a complaint about a course or experience should follow Troy University's complaint policy. If a student located in a State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (SARA) state has a complaint about Troy University, complaints must first go through the complaint policy referenced above. If a student is not satisfied with the outcome of that process, a complaint involving allegations of fraudulent activity, including the provision of false or misleading information, may be brought to the Alabama State Portal Entity (ASPE). The SARA portal entity in the state where the student is located will be notified that the complaint was received and may assist as needed. Resolution of the complaint by the SARA portal entity in the institution's home state is final. Examples of types of student complaints that may be brought to a SARA portal entity include, but are not limited to, complaints regarding accuracy of job placement data, tuition or fee information, accreditation, whether a program meets licensure requirements or course transfer information. Grade appeals and student conduct appeals are not allowed under SARA. Troy University provides global access to its online degree programs. While we carefully track issues related to international authorization and licensure, it is a student's responsibility to understand requirements related to whether an online degree will be recognized in a country other than the United States or how the collection of student data may be used in another country. Some countries may not formally recognize foreign online degrees, which may have implications for students who later seek to enroll in other educational programs or for those who seek employment with that country's government or other employers requiring specific credentials. International students considering an academic program that leads to a professional license should first confirm with the appropriate professional licensing board in their country of residence or the country where they intend to work as to whether a Troy University online degree will be recognized when seeking licensure or certification. Alabama students (and those in the states listed below that have reciprocity with Alabama) who have not reached a satisfactory resolution upon completion of the institutional grievance process may file a complaint with the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Troy University is authorized for operation as a postsecondary educational institution by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Click on the State Authorization link. Affected students enrolled in out-of-state online college programs can file complaints at www.dca.ca.gov, or call the Department's Consumer Information Center at (833) 942-1120.

Troy University is a participating member in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is overseen by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. For the State of Alabama, this is the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB). Once a state has joined SARA, and then subsequently approves a school or college as a participating institution, a university may offer distance education to students residing in SARA participating states. Approved institutions will have no restrictions on advertising, marketing, program offerings and minimal restrictions on clinical practice and internships (no greater than 10 students at one location). The following states are SARA Authorized for Troy University: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming For a list of Alabama approved institutions, see: http://www.nc-sara.org/states/AL. For a list of currently approved institutions and participating states, see: http://www.nc-sara.org/sara-states-institutions. Additional measures are required for students that currently reside in a state not participating in SARA. If you are a student who currently resides in a state not listed and would like to take a class at Troy University, please contact the Coordinator of State Authorizations, Tamara Broadnax. We are also currently investigating any additional state-by-state considerations for programs that include licensure, practicums and internships that may affect the ability to serve students in certain states for particular programs. If you have any questions about your eligibility for a program that includes licensure, practicum or internship, please contact the Coordinator of State Authorizations, Tamara Broadnax.

Bill®, the Tuition Assistance Program, the MyCAA initiative, private funding and other financing options. Troy University is an educational partner with the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The TROY for Troops Centers, established at our Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, Phenix City and Pensacola, FL locations, as well as our virtual center at TROY Online, exist to help service members (Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve), veterans and their families as they transition into college life.

More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. The University has pledged to close any gap between the benefits provided under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 and the cost of tuition at Troy University by paying 50 percent of the established tuition and fee charges not already covered under the bill. A special provision of the bill establishes the Yellow Ribbon Program that allows colleges and universities to offer the tuition waiver. The Department of Veterans Affairs will match each additional dollar funded by the University. The University's Financial Aid Office stands ready to assist with any issues regarding the VA benefit programs. Troy University recognizes the educational benefits of many experiences that occur outside the formal structure of accredited colleges and universities.

Emergency Notification to the campus is accomplished in many ways. Below is a listing of the systems used to notify the campus in case of an emergency and to keep the campus informed during a crisis situation. Omnilert is part of Troy University's efforts to provide an accurate and timely information to our university community as a mass. With the Omnilert system Troy can swiftly notify anyone that has registered prior to an event. Troy can now inform constituents of unexpected events including: The Omnilert system can instantly send notification to a subscriber through a number of devices. A list of supported devices follows: In order to subscribe to the services, you must have a Trojan Email Account. Your Trojan Email Account credentials will provide access to the subscription page. One may change subscription information as frequently as desired. To subscribe go to sos.troy.edu and click on Omnilert Login. You must enter you Trojan Email address and Trojan password. Follow the instructions on the next screen and fill in all information requested. You may also request an “email only” notification. No unsolicited messages or SPAM messages will be sent because Omnilert enforces a “ZERO SPAM” policy. SOS-Emergency Notification is a web page created and maintained by the Information Technology Department to post emergency notifications to the web. Persons may access this site by going to sos.troy.edu. Notifications on this web site include campus crisis, severe weather, technology outages, etc. This page is also used to share information and to keep the campus community up to date on any emergency situation. In case of a campus emergency or severe weather, a link will be placed on the home page directing persons to the sos.troy.edu page. Call Burst System is a means to notify a large group of people at one time utilizing the University telephone system. This system is similar to a reverse 911 system whereby a message is sent to multiple telephone lines in a matter of seconds. Presently, all Building Safety Monitors and several administrative offices are included in the Call Burst System. In case of an emergency, this system is activated to forward a message. Building Safety Monitors are assigned to all buildings on the campus to include the residence halls. There primary monitors and alternates for all buildings. It is the role of these people to verbally notify classes and other groups of people in case of an emergency. These people assist in the securing of a building and the evacuation of a building if necessary. Campus Siren System is a notification system that will be activated in case of an emergency. The sirens are located on top of many of the blue light phones. There are three distinct sounds that can be sounded from the sirens. One is a weather siren sound that mimics the county-wide weather sirens. These are used to supplement the county sirens in notifying the campus of approaching adverse weather. The second sound is simply a sound that notifies the campus that some type emergency situation or crisis has occurred. Students and others will receive a text or email message concerning the particulars of the situation. Students not have text or email available to them should contact a faculty or staff member or get on the web and go to sos.troy.edu for additional information. The last sound on the siren system is a series of short beeps that denotes an “all-clear” signal. Only after this sound has the emergency situation passed and the campus will be returning to normal operations. By the “Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act” of 2000, which amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, the Jeanne Clery Act, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, the Troy University Police Department is providing a link to the Alabama Bureau of Investigation Sex Offender Registry. This act requires higher education institutions to issue a statement advising the campus community where law enforcement information provided by a State concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained. It also requires sex offenders already required to register in a State to provide notice of each institution of higher education in that State at which the person is employed, carries a vocation, or is a student. In the State of Alabama, convicted sex offenders must register with the Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. The Sex Offender Registry is available via the Internet under Title 15 Article 2 Section 15-20-25, Adult criminal sex offender - Community Notification Procedures, of the Code of Alabama. Registry information provided under this section shall be used for the administration of criminal justice, screening of current or prospective employees, volunteers, or otherwise for the protection of the public in general and children in particular. The Alabama Bureau of Investigation is responsible for maintaining this registry. Click to access the Alabama Bureau of Investigation The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, Section 1601 of Public Law 106-386, was enacted on October 28, 2002. This law is intended to guarantee that when a convicted sex offender enrolls or begins employment at a college or university, members of the campus community will have the information that they need to protect themselves. Specifically, this Act amends or extends several federal laws, including the Jason Wetterling Act, Megan's Law, and the Jeanne Clery Act, by requiring that: Sex offenders are already required to register in a given state and provide notice, as required under the state's law, of each institution of higher education in which that person is a student or at which the person is employed or carries on a vacation. State procedures ensure that this registration information is promptly made available to law enforcement agencies having jurisdiction over the area where the institution of higher education is located. States enter this information into appropriate State records or data systems. Institutions of higher education issue a statement, in addition to other disclosures required by law, advising the campus community where the law enforcement agency information provided by a State concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained. In addition, the Act amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) by clarifying that nothing in FERPA may be construed as prohibiting an educational institution from disclosing information provided to the institution concerning registered sex offenders and requires the Secretary of Education to take appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that disclosure of this information is permitted. The Alabama Bureau of Investigation will provide the Troy University Police Department with a list of registered sex offenders who have indicated that they are either enrolled or employed at Troy University. These will be people who are considered adults who have been convicted of a sex offense as defined by law. Names of juveniles and those granted youthful offender status will not be released. This list will be maintained on the Troy University Police Department website with the TROY webmaster. The police department will be responsible for furnishing the list to the webmaster, who will post this information on the website. The list will include the following: The Troy University Police Department will also contact the responsible person on each other's campus when information concerning a student and employee enrolled and employed on that campus is received. Each campus will publish a statement in each Annual Campus Safety/Crime Statistics Report where this registry may be found. Anyone interested in this list may visit the website to obtain the information. Additionally, each campus will publish the Alabama Bureau of Investigation website, which will list all registered sex offenders in the State of Alabama. Students or employees who have failed to register as a sex offender properly may be removed from housing and the University and terminated if employed, as deemed necessary. Each campus's Office of Student Affairs will work with the Enrollment Management Offices to review all student applicants who indicate they have been convicted of a crime. If it is determined that the potential student is a convicted sex offender, verification will be made by the Troy University Police Department on the Troy campus. Additionally, the conviction's circumstances will be reviewed before the person is admitted to school. The Human Resources Offices will also review the list periodically as people who apply for employment indicate they have been convicted of a crime. Troy University will work with the other local law enforcement offices to ensure information concerning sex offenders is shared among departments. Questions or comments?

About Us,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University's tradition of teaching excellence dates to its founding on February 26, 1887, when an act of the Alabama Legislature established Troy State Normal School as an institution to train teachers for Alabama's schools. Joseph Macon Dill was the institution's first president. In 1893, the school was renamed Troy State Normal College. The Normal College offered extension courses for teachers and granted teaching certificates until 1929, when the State Board of Education changed the charter of the institution and renamed it Troy State Teacher's College. That same year, the college moved to its present site and the first two buildings were dedicated: Shackelford Hall, named for Edward Madison Shackelford, president of the school from 1899-1936, and Bibb Graves Hall, named for David Bibb Graves, Alabama's “education governor.” Governor Bibb Graves is also remembered for commissioning the Olmsted Brothers architectural firm of Brookline, Massachusetts, to design the campus landscape plan. The building has since been renamed to honor the memory of Civil Rights icon and longtime Georgia Congressman John Robert Lewis, a Pike County native. Like many American universities, Troy State Teacher's College enjoyed one of its most prosperous periods of growth in the years following World War II when returning veterans took advantage of the VA Educational Benefits. The enrollment of the College more than doubled and this growth led to the introduction of degree programs in disciplines other than education, most notably in business. In 1957, the State Board of Education recognized this expanded role and dropped “Teacher's” from Troy State College's name. The decade of the 1950s also marked the University's long relationship with the United States Military, as extension courses were offered on nearby bases, first at then-Fort Rucker, near Dothan, and later at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery. A separate Troy State College teaching center was established at Fort Rucker in 1961, which evolved into the present-day Dothan Campus. A similar center, begun at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1965, led to the creation of the present-day Montgomery Campus. These programs were the forerunners of the modern TROY Service Centers division of Troy University, which operates all TROY teaching sites outside Alabama. In 1973, the University opened sites at military bases in Florida. Today, TROY Service Centers operate some 20 sites in seven U.S. states, at locations in Japan and South Korea, and partnerships with universities in Vietnam and Malaysia. In 1967, Gov. Lurleen B. Wallace appointed eight members to the newly established Troy State College Board of Trustees, removing the institution from the control of the State Board of Education. One of the first acts of the new board was to recommend the change of the name to Troy State University. The new name became official on Dec. 14, 1967. In 1975, the Phenix City Campus was opened as a branch of the main campus. In 1982, the Troy State University System was formed, as the campuses in Dothan and Montgomery were granted independent accreditation status. In April of 2004 the Board of Trustees voted to drop ""State"" from the University's name to better reflect the institution's worldwide mission. Starting August 2005, all TROY campuses were again unified under one accreditation. View Historical Timeline Troy University is committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all students, faculty and staff. The University's Board of Trustees demonstrated this commitment with the approval of a resolution designating Troy University as a tobacco-free institution.

It is important to preserve all evidence of sexual discrimination, especially if the description is also a criminal offense, such as sexual assault, sexual violence, stalking, domestic violence or dating violence. Supervisors and staff members must recognize that their positions necessarily embody unequal power relationships with their subordinates and students. Because of the inherent power of differences in these relationships, the potential exists for the less powerful to perceive a coercive element in suggestions relative to activities outside those appropriate to the professional relationship. It is the responsibility of supervisors and staff members to behave in such a manner that their words or actions cannot reasonably be perceived as coercive. Troy University is committed to an environment for all faculty, staff, students and visitors that is free from sexual discrimination including sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual violence, stalking, domestic violence and dating violence. No form of sexual discrimination will be tolerated. Definitions: The definitions below are simply provided as guidance for a person wishing to file a complaint. They are not all inclusive and all complaints will be reviewed by the Title IX Coordinator or a designee. Bullying is an unacceptable habitual behavior in which coercion and intimidation are used to dominate others who are considered inferior or different. Bullying is typically not the fault of the victims as they are not usually the cause but the fault of the bullies who need to tear others down to feel superior. Cyber Bullying shares every characteristic of the previously discussed bullying except that it is perpetrated through electronic technology and electronic communication. It usually involves threats, name calling. Harassment, humiliation, to name a few. Dating violence is when someone you are seeing romantically harms you in some way, whether it is physically, sexually, emotionally, or all three. It can happen on a first date, or once you've fallen deeply in love. Dating violence is never your fault. Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behavior that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control through physical, sexual, or emotional abuse over another intimate partner. Gender Discrimination is the unfair, biased and condescending treatment of people based on their gender. II stems from the society's assignment of roles based on whether one is male or female. This assignment presents the impression that these allocated roles cannot be swapped successfully between men and women. Hence, a gender is relegated to the background even when they possess characteristics that qualify them for roles the society has not assigned them. Gender Inequity is closely related to gender discrimination except that when males and females are assigned same roles, one group is better compensated than the other not based on their performance but on their gender. Harassment based on gender or gender identity is a form of sex discrimination. It occurs when one person harasses another person for reasons relating to their gender or the gender with which they identify. Non-consensual sexual contact is any intentional sexual touching, however slight, with any body part or object by an individual upon another individual without consent. Intentional sexual contact includes contact with the breasts, buttocks, or groin, or touching another with any of these body parts; making another person touch any of these body parts; and any intentional bodily contact in a sexual manner. Non-consensual sexual intercourse is sex between two parties where one person does not expressly agree to have sex. Parenting and Pregnancy Discrimination prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parental status-in educational programs and activities. Rape is an aggravated sexual assault in which sexual intercourse or sexual penetration is achieved, in the presence or absence of coercion, without the victim's consent. Statutory rape occurs when the victim is not old enough to grant a legal consent to sexual relations. Retaliation is any action taken against a person as a repercussion for speaking up against a cause or defending one that does not suit the interests of the persons taking the actions. Despite being frowned upon by the law, retaliation, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),"" is the most frequently alleged basis of discrimination in the federal sector and the most common discrimination finding in federal sector cases."" Relationship Violence is the intentional, intimidating, and repetitive verbal, physical, emotional, and psychological abuse of an intimate partner by an intimate partner in order to gain total control or power over the relationship. Relationship violence is not always noticeable at the beginning of a relationship but can escalate with time. Sexual Assault is any sexual contact or activity that occurs without the recipients willing and expressive consent. Often misunderstood, sexual assault is not narrowed down to just sex intercourse, but also to activities that suggest sex. Sexual Harassment according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is ""Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature."" It could range from subtle looks to touch to expressive verbal communication. Sexual Misconduct is the umbrella term for any misbehavior of a sexual nature. That includes the aforementioned sexual harassment and sexual assault. Stalking is a compulsive, obsessive, usually irritating attention and monitoring by one or more persons. Under more serious situations, stalking could be a criminal offence of first or second degree depending on whether or not the victim is put in reasonable fear of death. Troy University is obligated to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. §1681 et seq., Title IX is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex—including pregnancy and parental status—in educational programs and activities.

Privacy and confidentiality: All activities under these grievance procedures shall be conducted with due regard for any legitimate privacy and reputational interests of those involved. It is expected that any materials and information prepared or acquired under these grievance procedures will be shared only with those who have a legitimate need to know. Disclosure of such information may also be made if it is permitted by law and the University Title IX Coordinator determines in his or her judgment: (1) that such disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or well-being of members of the Troy community; or (2) that such disclosure advances the interests of those involved in the process and/or the University and outweighs the interest in confidentiality.

If a complainant wishes to appeal the decisions of the Title IX Coordinator or a University Conduct Board he/she may make a written appeal as outline in University policies and procedures. Complainants who are considering bringing a formal grievance may at any time meet with the University Title IX Coordinator, who will discuss the matter and describe the formal grievance process. Alternatively, a complainant may choose to submit a written grievance to the University Title IX Coordinator (including via use of the available Title IX grievance form). A formal grievance process is initiated when a complainant submits a written statement alleging discrimination prohibited by Title IX to the University Title IX Coordinator. In the statement, the complainant is encouraged to request any relief sought from the University. Prompt submission of formal grievances is encouraged. The University Title IX Coordinator will consider the written grievance, and may dismiss the grievance without further process or review if the University Title IX Coordinator determines that the grievance on its face is frivolous, not credible, clearly without merit, or outside the scope of these grievance procedures. If the grievance is not dismissed, the University Title IX Coordinator will interview the individual who submitted the written statement. Depending on the circumstances, the University Title IX Coordinator also may interview others with relevant knowledge, review documentary materials, and take any other appropriate action to gather and consider information relevant to the grievance. The University Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the complainant was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of sex under any University program or activity, using a preponderance of the evidence standard. The University Title IX Coordinator will consult with other University offices as necessary in reaching a decision regarding the written grievance.

It is expected that any materials and information prepared or acquired under these grievance procedures will be shared only with those who have a legitimate need to know. Disclosure of such information may also be made if it is permitted by law and the University Title IX Coordinator determines in his or her judgment: (1) that such disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or well-being of members of the Troy community; or (2) that such disclosure advances the interests of those involved in the process and/or the University and outweighs the interest in confidentiality. While the University Title IX Coordinator will take into account any requests made by a complainant for confidentiality or that a Title IX grievance not be investigated, the University Title IX Coordinator must take appropriate steps to respond to the grievance consistent with the requirements of Title IX. Retaliation: Retaliation against any person in the University community either for alleging discrimination prohibited by Title IX or for cooperating in these grievance procedures is strictly prohibited. Standard of Evidence: The University Title IX Coordinator shall review allegations of discrimination prohibited by Title IX by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard. Right of Appeal and Review of Disciplinary Proceedings: The University Title IX Coordinator does not make a determination on or review a disciplinary process's factual findings, conclusions, or imposed penalty.

Any Community Member who believes that he/she has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by Title IX, or that the University has failed to meet its Title IX obligations, may bring the concern to the attention of the University Title IX Coordinator. While the University Title IX Coordinator welcomes an informal presentation of such allegations, and is available to address concerns through counseling, advice, and informal resolution, the University Title IX Coordinator is fully prepared to receive and address such allegations through formal grievance procedures. The University Title IX Coordinator has the authority to investigate allegations of discrimination prohibited by Title IX even absent the filing of a formal grievance, or its subsequent withdrawal. In addition, the University Title IX Coordinator may proceed with investigating a formal or informal grievance even if a complainant specifically requests that the matter not be pursued. In such a circumstance, the University Title IX Coordinator will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the matter in a manner which is informed by the complainant's articulated concerns. In most circumstances, the University Title IX Coordinator will coordinate his/her activities with other University offices charged with responsibilities for student, faculty and staff conduct and discipline and for enforcing the University's policies and procedures generally.

At any point, including while the informal process is ongoing or afterward, the complainant may elect to end the informal process in favor of filing a formal grievance. Although Troy welcomes informal resolution of grievances when appropriate, it will not use mediation between a complainant and alleged perpetrator or any other informal resolution mechanism to resolve grievances pertaining to non-consensual sexual contact or non-consensual sexual penetration, as defined by the University Policy on Sexual Misconduct. Complainants who are considering bringing a formal grievance may at any time meet with the University Title IX Coordinator, who will discuss the matter and describe the formal grievance process. Alternatively, a complainant may choose to submit a written grievance to the University Title IX Coordinator (including via use of the available Title IX grievance form). A formal grievance process is initiated when a complainant submits a written statement alleging discrimination prohibited by Title IX to the University Title IX Coordinator. In the statement, the complainant is encouraged to request any relief sought from the University. Prompt submission of formal grievances is encouraged. The University Title IX Coordinator will consider the written grievance, and may dismiss the grievance without further process or review if the University Title IX Coordinator determines that the grievance on its face is frivolous, not credible, clearly without merit, or outside the scope of these grievance procedures. If the grievance is not dismissed, the University Title IX Coordinator will interview the individual who submitted the written statement. Depending on the circumstances, the University Title IX Coordinator also may interview others with relevant knowledge, review documentary materials, and take any other appropriate action to gather and consider information relevant to the grievance. The University Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the complainant was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of sex under any University program or activity, using a preponderance of the evidence standard. The University Title IX Coordinator will consult with other University offices as necessary in reaching a decision regarding the written grievance. The University Title IX Coordinator will prepare a written report setting forth findings, conclusions, and actions to be taken, if any, and will determine with whom to share the report. Following such review, the University's Title IX Coordinator will, as necessary, take appropriate action to ensure that the University comes into compliance with Title IX in a manner which is prompt and equitable to the complainant. For example, the University Title IX Coordinator may assure that appropriate changes to housing, academic programs or working conditions are implemented. While the action taken by the Title IX Coordinator may impact third parties, such action is not intended to be punitive (or constitute disciplinary penalty) with respect to these third parties.

Throughout the process, the University Title IX Coordinator will, as appropriate, keep the participants informed of the status of the grievance process. Regardless of whether student disciplinary proceedings or a criminal charge are pending or being investigated pertaining to an allegation of student sexual misconduct, and irrespective of their outcome, Troy University shall take steps to meet its responsibility to provide an environment where no member of its community is, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. In addition to the procedures described above, the following additional procedures apply in allegations of student-on-student sexual harassment and/or discrimination. The University Title IX Coordinator shall be available as a resource to any dean or other Troy faculty or staff member who receives an allegation of student-on-student sexual harassment and/or discrimination, and the University Title IX Coordinator shall be promptly informed of any such allegation. As indicated above, following appropriate investigation and review, the University Title IX Coordinator or the campus Point of Contact shall determine and promptly implement any remedies that he/she believes are necessary to maintain an environment free from harassment and/or discrimination and to protect the safety and well-being of community members. Such remedies may include, but are not limited to, no-contact orders, academic accommodations, housing accommodations, counseling services, campus escorts, and educational or outreach initiatives. Adjustments to a student(s)' educational environment may be taken on an interim or permanent basis. Any adjustments in that regard would not be punitive, and, as such, would not appear on any student disciplinary record. At any point during an informal or formal Title IX grievance procedure, the University Title IX Coordinator may, at his/her discretion, inform other University officials of the possibility that a violation of the University's Code of Conduct and/or disciplinary policies may have taken place. These procedures do not replace the University's student disciplinary processes, including the appeal processes specified therein. While the University Title IX Coordinator will review grievance claims as to whether the University has fulfilled its obligations under Title IX, including whether student disciplinary processes were conducted in a manner free of discrimination, it is not the function of the University Title IX Coordinator to hear appeals from, rehear or otherwise resolve student discipline matters based on their content.",https://www.troy.edu/about-us/leadership/student-services-administration/title-ix-save-act.html

Helen Keller Lecture Series,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Combat-wounded Staff Sergeant (Ret.) Joey Jones will be the featured speaker for the 2025 Helen Keller Lecture Series.Tune in on April 29 to view Live Stream. Combat-wounded Staff Sergeant (Ret.) Joey Jones turned a traumatic, life-changing disability into a personal mission to share the life-changing perspective and gratitude he found in his recovery. Joey is an in-demand contributor across all FOX News Media platforms, including FOX News Channel, FOX Business Network (FBN) and FOX Nation Streaming. The New York Times best-selling author is a rotating host for several hit shows including the Fox and Friends franchise, The Five, Big Weekend Show and the primetime show Fox News Tonight. The Helen Keller Lecture Series, which began in 1995 as the vision of Dr. and Mrs. Jack Hawkins, Jr., was initiated to call attention to and raise awareness of the challenges of those with physical limitations, particularly those affecting sensory ability. Through the years, the lecture has also provided the opportunity to highlight those who have devoted their careers to meeting the needs of the sensory impaired and to celebrate the collaborative efforts and partnerships of Troy University and the agencies and individuals who serve these special individuals. Joey's easy rapport with, and genuine concern for, people of all walks of life has led to a long list of speaking opportunities. His message focuses on overcoming adversity, finding a positive perspective in dire situations, leaning on those around you, and finding strength in yourself and your community. Whether it be on live television, in writing or speaking to a live audience, his genuine demeanor, thoughtful approach and innate humor allow him to masterfully connect with people on a gamut of issues. He simply believes we all need the opportunity to remind ourselves what we're capable of overcoming. Joey has created a unique and impactful message on the value we bring to others and the necessity to build strong relationships with our teams, family and community. Jones was raised in Dalton, Georgia. He worked with his dad and uncles as a brick mason in the summers and played football in the fall. After high school, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. During his eight years of service, he worked as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal (bomb) Technician, deploying to both Iraq and Afghanistan on separate tours. During his last deployment to Afghanistan, Joey's team rendered safe and destroyed nearly 80 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) along with thousands of pounds of other unknown bulk explosives. It was during that tour on August 6, 2010, when he stepped on and initiated an IED, resulting in the loss of both of his legs above the knee and severe damage to his right forearm and both wrists. He recovered at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington D.C. Determined to make the road to recovery easier for his fellow wounded veterans, Jones founded a peer visit program at Walter Reed, providing opportunities for others recovering to mentor and encourage newly injured patients. His dedication and relentlessness led to an unprecedented year-long fellowship on Capitol Hill with the House of Representatives Veterans' Affairs Committee. His work resulted in the creation of an annual fellowship for a wounded Marine. During his recovery, Joey took classes on campus at Walter Reed. In July 2011, after regaining his full physical independence - only ten months after his injury, Joey sought the best possible education and enrolled at Georgetown University. He completed his education in May 2014. His time at Georgetown fostered relationships and efforts that are still changing the lives of veteran students on campus today. After losing his childhood best friend, a Marine, to PTSD-related suicide in 2012, Joey decided to make veterans' issues a key part of his professional and personal life. Throughout his post-service career, he has carefully fostered relationships with key players in politics and the media to keep veteran issues at the forefront of discussion. He has shared his experiences and insights on the challenges facing active duty and retired service members at the White House with then-President Obama and in conversation with former President George W. Bush. He often visits with multiple cabinet officials and military generals and enjoys a close personal and working relationship with current members of Congress. An avid outdoorsman, Jones grew up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, where he learned the hard work and culture of ethical hunting while helping his uncle commercially clean and process wild game. Over the past decade, Joey has used his platform and passion to become an advocate for hunting, fishing, outdoor recreation and habitat conservation. Joey hosts the first hunting show featured on a major cable news property, Fox Nation Outdoors, and spends his personal time and resources taking small groups of veterans and first responders on unforgettable hunting retreats. Joey's deployment, injury and subsequent recovery were documented on ABC Nightline and CBS Evening News. His family's colorful past as moonshiners and race car drivers was featured in the premiere episode of the hit series Religion of Sports. On the big screen, Jones has a speaking role in the Academy Award-winning film Lincoln, he appeared in the independent film Range 15, and was a technical advisor for the independent film Bad Hurt. His first book, which remained on the New York Times best-selling list for months, “Unbroken Bonds of Battle” was released on June 27, 2023. The book offers deep insight into the relationships and events that forged Joey's outlook on life. Throughout the book, Joey features ten American heroes who played an important part in his life and recovery, as well as showcasing their own stories of bravery and determination. You'll find gold star family members, childhood best friends, professional athletes, politicians and wounded warriors, all with an enlightening take on how to get through hardships. Prior to joining FOX News, Joey helped design and pilot a Warrior Week military transition program as the senior advisor to military programming at musician Zac Brown's Camp Southern Ground. Joey currently serves on the Board of Directors for the national nonprofit Boot Campaign, which serves the health and wellness of the veteran community through a pipeline of treatment resources. Helen Keller, an Alabamian and American author and lecturer, overcame considerable obstacles to become an inspiration for others with disabilities. Born in Tuscumbia, Alabama, she contracted an illness at 19 months old that left her deaf and blind. For years, there was no way to educate her until, at age seven, she began her special education in reading and writing with Anne Sullivan. Miss Keller quickly learned to read using the Braille system and to write using a specially constructed typewriter. In 1890, after only one month of study, she learned to speak. Ten years later, she was able to enter Radcliffe College, where she graduated with honors in 1904. Miss Keller then served on the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind and, shortly thereafter, began lecturing throughout the world. After World War II, she visited wounded veterans in United States hospitals and lectured in Europe on behalf of those with physical impairments. Her writings include “The Story of My Life,” “The World I Live In,” “Out of the Dark,” “Midstream,” “My Later Life,” “Let Us Have Faith,” ""Teacher: Anne Sullivan Macy” and “The Open Door.” Her life is the subject of the film, “The Unconquered,” and the play, “The Miracle Worker,” which was made into an award-winning film by American author William Gibson. For 27 years the following agencies have co-sponsored the event: Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, Alabama Department of Mental Health, Alabama Department of Rehabilitation, Alabama State Department of Education, Helen Keller Foundation and Troy University. Wounded combat veteran and regular Fox News contributor Johnny ‘Joey' Jones will deliver the annual Helen Keller Lecture at Troy University on April 29 on the Troy Campus.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/education/helen-keller.html

Opportunities for personal development include: UHGSP encourages scholars to contribute to their communities through various service initiatives. Opportunities include those provided by the office of Civic Engagement: Connecting Place to its Multitudes is a project that is funded the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation— the nation's largest supporter of the arts and humanities A place is more than its physical location; it is shaped by its larger histories and cultures, as well as by the human affects associated with those encounters. Practitioners and performers in the arts and humanities are not just chroniclers but also interpreters of these human affects, exploring the intricate relationships between cultural meaning and social values. Arts can enrich the humanities by providing diverse mediums through which to explore human experiences. Through close reading and critical analysis of artistic expressions—such as literature, visual art, music, and performance— we gain deeper insights into historical contexts, social issues, and identity formation. This interdisciplinary approach fosters critical thinking, enhances creativity, and encourages empathy, allowing us to connect more profoundly with the complexities of the human condition. This project seeks to confront the dominant narrative of lack in Alabama by engaging with its diverse cultural productions in literature, music, dance, theater, and art to reveal and interpret the manifold experiences and emotions of its varied people. The project aims to deepen the understanding of Alabama's cultural identity to foster social justice through research, curriculum development, and community engagement. The University Honors Program, in collaboration with the College of Communication and Fine Arts, leads this initiative. Troy University has unveiled an elite honors program aimed at fostering academic excellence, global engagement and leadership among its top scholars. pmenon@troy.edu honors@troy.edu",https://www.troy.edu/academics/university-honors-global-scholars-program.html

"Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Effectiveness","Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Institutional Research, Planning & Effectiveness (IRPE) office provides the services needed by Troy University for the primary functions of institutional research, planning, and effectiveness. Institutional research requires that analyses, reports, and surveys be prepared for the University, federal agencies, state agencies and other external agencies; that a facilities inventory be maintained; and that relevant University information be published online for ready access by University personnel. Institutional planning requires the coordination of activities for annual and strategic planning as well as the provision of data, statistics, and information to assist in planning and decision making. To ensure that planning coincides with expectations of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), members of the IRPE staff assist the University's liaisons with ACHE and with SACSCOC. Institutional effectiveness requires that IRPE coordinate all aspects of the effectiveness process including establishment of expected outcomes and verification that University programs and services assess expected outcomes, plan accordingly, and provide evidence of improvements based on the effectiveness process. To aid in providing assessment of outcomes, the IRPE office assists with general studies assessment, satisfaction surveys of students, and some Major Field Tests.

About Us,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University's tradition of teaching excellence dates to its founding on February 26, 1887, when an act of the Alabama Legislature established Troy State Normal School as an institution to train teachers for Alabama's schools. Joseph Macon Dill was the institution's first president. In 1893, the school was renamed Troy State Normal College. The Normal College offered extension courses for teachers and granted teaching certificates until 1929, when the State Board of Education changed the charter of the institution and renamed it Troy State Teacher's College. That same year, the college moved to its present site and the first two buildings were dedicated: Shackelford Hall, named for Edward Madison Shackelford, president of the school from 1899-1936, and Bibb Graves Hall, named for David Bibb Graves, Alabama's “education governor.” Governor Bibb Graves is also remembered for commissioning the Olmsted Brothers architectural firm of Brookline, Massachusetts, to design the campus landscape plan. The building has since been renamed to honor the memory of Civil Rights icon and longtime Georgia Congressman John Robert Lewis, a Pike County native. Like many American universities, Troy State Teacher's College enjoyed one of its most prosperous periods of growth in the years following World War II when returning veterans took advantage of the VA Educational Benefits. The enrollment of the College more than doubled and this growth led to the introduction of degree programs in disciplines other than education, most notably in business. In 1957, the State Board of Education recognized this expanded role and dropped “Teacher's” from Troy State College's name. The decade of the 1950s also marked the University's long relationship with the United States Military, as extension courses were offered on nearby bases, first at then-Fort Rucker, near Dothan, and later at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery. A separate Troy State College teaching center was established at Fort Rucker in 1961, which evolved into the present-day Dothan Campus. A similar center, begun at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1965, led to the creation of the present-day Montgomery Campus. These programs were the forerunners of the modern TROY Service Centers division of Troy University, which operates all TROY teaching sites outside Alabama. In 1973, the University opened sites at military bases in Florida. Today, TROY Service Centers operate some 20 sites in seven U.S. states, at locations in Japan and South Korea, and partnerships with universities in Vietnam and Malaysia. In 1967, Gov. Lurleen B. Wallace appointed eight members to the newly established Troy State College Board of Trustees, removing the institution from the control of the State Board of Education. One of the first acts of the new board was to recommend the change of the name to Troy State University. The new name became official on Dec. 14, 1967. In 1975, the Phenix City Campus was opened as a branch of the main campus. In 1982, the Troy State University System was formed, as the campuses in Dothan and Montgomery were granted independent accreditation status. In April of 2004 the Board of Trustees voted to drop ""State"" from the University's name to better reflect the institution's worldwide mission. Starting August 2005, all TROY campuses were again unified under one accreditation. View Historical Timeline Troy University is committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all students, faculty and staff. The University's Board of Trustees demonstrated this commitment with the approval of a resolution designating Troy University as a tobacco-free institution. This policy, which went into effect on August 13, 2012, prohibits smoking and the use of all tobacco products within all University buildings, parking lots, structures, walkways, indoor and outdoor athletic facilities, University vehicles, worksites and grounds and any vehicles on campus regardless of ownership. The health care and health education programs of the University perform an important function by demonstrating and promoting healthy lifestyles through activities such as curtailment of the use of tobacco products. Smoking"" means inhaling, exhaling, burning or carrying any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette or pipe. ""Tobacco Products"" such as all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes (hookah), electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (e.g. chewing tobacco and snuff). ""Members of the University Community"" include its faculty, staff, students, volunteers, vendors, customers and visitors. This policy applies to all Troy University employees, students, contractors, vendors, recruits and visitors. The use of all tobacco products is prohibited on all property that is owned, operated, leased, occupied or controlled by the University. ""Property"" for the purposes of this paragraph includes buildings and structures, grounds, parking lots, non-public walkways, sidewalks and vehicles, as well as personal vehicles in these areas. These same policies apply for all TROY campuses and locations. Troy University will provide a variety of wellness initiatives to assist students, faculty and staff to achieve nicotine independence and smoking cessation. Troy University (TROY) maintains an effective and continuous approach to evaluating its success with respect to student achievement based on its mission to provide a variety of educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels for a diverse student body.

Sylvia Horowitz,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: With all due respect to one of the South’s most acclaimed writers, Thomas Wolfe, I think this weekend attests to the fact that you can go home again. Charles, John and I – and many of our cousins – made life decisions that took us physically away from Montgomery, but much of what we experienced here growing up has remained deeply embedded in our hearts and souls. Ask our friends and relatives who tire of hearing what they think are our idealized stories and memories – but we insist, “No, it really was that way, that was our experience – our friends really were that wonderful, we really did have that much fun and life was really that good.” So when Patti chose Montgomery as the place to create a lasting memory of Charles, as the place to honor him, it seemed fitting. It’s home in so many ways. But Thomas Wolfe was also right because the theme of the book is that life is about change, and that’s what we’re here today to celebrate. Not all children in Montgomery were growing up the way we did – and many children did not experience the safety, comfort and security that we did. So today we’re here to honor and pay tribute to the changemakers and to change itself. We want to honor the people who have taken risks and put themselves in harm’s way and have worked to bring about change that makes life better for all of us – and the people who have made Montgomery a place more accepting of diversity. We feel pride to know that Montgomery is home to the Equal Justice Initiative, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Rosa Parks Museum, the Civil Rights Memorial – and to many of our friends who have contributed in making Montgomery more open and inclusive. Charles and the rest of us are proud to be a part of this. Martin Luther King said that one day the South will recognize its true heroes. We hope that today is a part of this recognition.",https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/about/charles-cahn-baum-family-atrium/sylvis-horowitz.html

National Accreditation,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University's Surveying and Geomatics Sciences Program has become one of the few in the country to receive national accreditation. TROY received accreditation from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the premier accrediting body in the country for engineering and technologies, retroactive to Oct. 1, 2010. ""We are very excited about this,"" said Dr. James Rinehart, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. ""This is yet another special accreditation within the College of Arts and Sciences and Troy University."" TROY's Surveying and Geomatics Sciences Program is the only one of its kind in the state of Alabama and one of less than about 30 in the country. Of those, fewer than 20 have been accredited. ""We've always been able to attract students regionally, but what this accreditation will do for us is attract students from the whole country,"" Rinehart said. Dr. Steve Ramroop, program director, said this accreditation will give the program's students national and international opportunities. ""Our students can apply to take land survey exams anywhere in the U.S.,"" Ramroop said. ""It's a measure of where we are in the program."" TROY began the accreditation process with an application, and then the program had to submit a thorough self-study report -- a report Rinehart said was noted by ABET as an exemplary self-study report at its national conference. Rinehart said the program, which is offered as an undergraduate degree on the campus in Troy only, hopes to expand soon to graduate and certificate programs. ""It's a growing program, and we are honored to be the school of choice in the state of Alabama as far as geomatics studies goes,"" he said. Both Rinehart and Ramroop contribute much of the program's success to its advisory board. Many members of the board are members of the Alabama Society of Professional Land Surveyors. ""They have provided tremendous support to our program since its inception,"" Ramroop said. TROY has offered geomatics studies since 1998. During early Spring 2011, a team of five TROY geomatics students took top honors nationally in the 10th Annual National Society of Professional Surveyors Competition for a Hydrographic survey of the 45-acre Pike County Lake that included hydrographic and topographic studies combined to form a digitized bathymetric chart to complete the survey. Dr. Steve Ramroop, director of Troy University's Surveying and Geomatics Sciences Program, brings practical experiences into the classroom for students in his program, which has recently earned national accreditation.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-arts-sciences/departments/school-science-technology/geospatial-informatics/news/national-accreditation.html

Military Credit,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Our institution proudly grants credit for military learning and/or experience using the ACE Military Guide. Learn more about which credits we accept and how we apply them to your degree at Troy University. The American Council on Education (ACE) was created in 1942 to recognize the educational value of military training and experience. Since that time ACE has continuously evaluated military schools, correspondence courses and occupations to determine the amount and level of academic credit each should be awarded. TROY recognizes and posts all military service credit with ACE credit recommended credits at the lower/upper-level associate/baccalaureate category. Vocational level credit is not recognized and duplicate credit for the same course award will not be allowed. In most cases, these credits will be used to fulfill free elective requirements. Further academic departmental review/substitution relative to the degree program may allow additional application of some eligible credit. TRANSCRIPTS OF MILITARY SERVICE for Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard - may be requested through the Joint Services Transcript (JST) website. (Click here for more information). AIR FORCE – CCAF (Community College of the Air Force) - https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Barnes/CCAF/ VETERANS – Veterans who are eligible may use the JST website as well. However, if you are not eligible for a Joint Services Transcript, you will need to provide your DD-214 Discharge Document to receive credit for your experience. A limited amount of graduate credit may be awarded for select Professional Military Education courses completed at select military service schools for which credit is recommended by the American Council on Education and approved by each appropriate College’s Dean. The credit will be awarded if approved by the appropriate academic department/Dean through the PETITION FOR TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDIT process. Graduate students must refer to their specific area of study in the graduate catalog to find out if such credit is an option for their program. No credit may be granted for any work that will be over eight years old at the time of graduation from the TROY program for which transfer credit is requested. Troy University recognizes the educational benefits of many experiences that occur outside the formal structure of accredited colleges and universities. Credit may be granted for military experience based on MOS (Army), AFSC (Air Force), or equivalent ratings by Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Our institution proudly grants credit for military learning and/or experience using the ACE Military Guide. Learn more about which credits we accept and how we apply them to your degree at Troy University. TROY is also a proud partner in two of the Air Force's specialized education initiatives: The General Education Mobility initiative (GEM), which is designed to facilitate completion of the General Education requirements of the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) associate degree program; and, the Air University Associate to Bachelor Co-operative (AU ABC), which was designed to create a seamless pathway from the CCAF associate degree to a bachelor degree in a range of disciplines. For more information on how CCAF credit can apply in a TROY bachelors degree, see sections below. For specific transfer credit application or inquiry as related to the AU ABC program, please email aec@troy.edu. The University offers a range of undergraduate degree programs that require an 18-semester hour minor. The MILITARY OPERATIONS minor will satisfy degree requirements for any minor required for a Bachelor of Science program. The Military Operations Minor can be completed by applying a minimum of 18 semester hours of credit earned through military service as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE), Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), or military credit from other regionally accredited institutions of higher education. Servicemembers can often apply coursework and experience of Professional Military Training and Education to this minor. Service school courses will be evaluated according to the recommendations of the American Council on Education (ACE Guide) when official credentials have been presented by the student. Such recommendations, however, are not binding upon the University. The ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE IN GENERAL EDUCATION degree allows for the use of at least 34 semester hours of military credit. The 60sh ASGE degree program is comprised of 26 semester hours of GENERAL STUDIES and 34 semester hours of FREE ELECTIVE credit. While all of the degree programs at TROY offer scope for the transfer of military credit, the University offers a selection of bachelor degree programs that are particularly accommodating to the military training and professional education undertaken by our men and women in uniform. These degree programs recognize the value of this professional training by allowing for the maximization of transferable credits and, subsequently, the shortening of the time to degree completion and graduation. The BACHELOR OF APPLIED SCIENCE degree program requires the completion of a 36 semester hour Resources and Technology Management major, of which 18sh must be ""Specialized Technical Credit."" One recognized source of such specialized credit is credit earned through military service as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) or Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). The 120sh BAS degree program is comprised of: 45sh GENERAL STUDIES/36sh RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT MAJOR/18sh MINOR/21sh of FREE ELECTIVE credit. (If available, up to 57sh of military credit may be applied in this degree program towards the 18sh specialization, the 18sh military operations minor, and the 21sh of free electives.) TROY’s BACHELOR OF OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION builds off of military training, an Associate of Applied Science or other technical degrees in fields such as welding technology, airframe repair or fire science that meet TROY’s General Studies requirements. The program is designed to give students the training and preparation it takes to become an instructor at a community college, technical college or four-year institution. The program also equips students to pursue positions as Department of Defense Civilians. The BSOE degree programs requires the completion of 30 semester hours of credentialed work-related experience which could include ACE recommended credit for professional military technical education or the Technical Education component of the CCAF degree. The 120sh BSOE degree program is comprised of: 45sh GENERAL STUDIES/60sh OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM/15sh FREE ELECTIVE credit. (If available, up to 45sh of military credit may be applied in this degree program towards the 30sh of occupational specialization and 15sh of free electives.) The purpose of the proposed BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES (BIS) is to provide an expanded degree program, across multiple disciplines, for the Troy University student. The BIS will provide opportunities for TROY students to create three areas of focused disciplinary learning, based on existing University courses or through the application of appropriate ACE recommended credit which can be used to fulfill the requirements of the University’s Military Operation minor thereby satisfying one of the three areas of focus required for the BIS degree. The 120sh BIS degree program is comprised of: 45sh GENERAL STUDIES/54sh comprised of 3 TROY minors (18sh each)/21sh FREE ELECTIVE credit. (If available, up to 57sh of military credit may be applied in this degree program towards the 18sh Military Operations minor/18sh Military Studies Contract minor, and 21sh of free electives.) Most undergraduate degree programs require some free elective credits, and some require as many as 20 semester hours of free elective credit.

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific discipline concerned with designing and implementing techniques based on learning principles to change behavior of social significance. In other words, ABA uses our understanding of how behavior works and applies it to real world situations. You can teach someone academic skills, daily living skills, social skills, etc. ABA is often used for children or adults with developmental disabilities and autism. However, ABA can be used to change socially-relevant behavior in a wide range of contexts (e.g., health, sports, organizations, education). Troy University offers an ABA minor with eighteen credit hours, including Practicum classes, during which students gain direct experience in ABA assessment and interventions.

Tuition Assistance Policy,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Tuition Assistance Program affords eligible participants the opportunity to take courses at one of the campuses/sites of Troy University at a reduced cost. In an effort to ensure timely processing of Tuition Assistance, please remember to submit all Tuition Assistance forms to the Human Resources Department. In order to ensure an employee or dependent is not assessed a late fee, all Tuition Assistance forms should be received in Human Resources at least two work weeks prior to the start of classes. Receiving the forms by the given deadline will guarantee that approved Tuition Assistance requests are awarded prior to any late charges being added to the student's account. If an employee/dependent submits a form after the stated deadline, there is no guarantee that Tuition Assistance will be processed prior to the date Student Financial Services adds late charges. Forms received after the first day of class will not be processed for tuition assistance. To clarify any misunderstanding with regard to dropping a class, please make sure to communicate administrative drops to Human Resources. If an employee or dependent drops a class covered by Tuition Assistance after the free drop/add period, it is the individual's responsibility to immediately notify Human Resources of the change. If notification is not made prior to the drop/add date, the student is responsible for paying all tuition and fees for the courses. Failure to notify Human Resources of post drop/add date withdrawals and failure to pay the associated tuition will result in the employee or dependent being ineligible for further tuition assistance. If you have questions regarding Tuition Assistance, please contact the Human Resources Department for assistance. Eligibility: Tuition Assistance Program is available to full-time regular employees of Troy University or the dependent of such an employee meeting eligibility requirements. Retirees that were eligible on their date of retirement and their dependents are also eligible. No part-time, temporary, or adjunct personnel will be eligible for any form of tuition assistance. Employees or dependents funded by Budgeted Restricted Funds (grants, contracts, non-recurring funding) are not eligible for Tuition Assistance unless specifically authorized and budgeted from their funding source. For purposes of this policy, a dependent is anyone eligible for Troy University health insurance. Dependents of an eligible participant who dies are eligible to continue the dependent's Tuition Assistance benefit if they are a senior in high school or have taken the first course under the dependent tuition assistance plan within the 12 months prior to the eligible participant's death. Individuals transitioning from dependent status to employee status will be eligible to continue receiving tuition assistance under the employee status. Dependents who are seniors in high school and are accepted into the Troy Early Admission Program are eligible for the Tuition Assistance Program if their parents meet all the other eligibility requirements. High School students who are dual enrolled or who participate in the Troy Accelerate Program are not eligible for tuition assistance for those courses. Eligibility Date: Tuition Assistance is effective after one calendar year of continuous full-time regular service. Interim, temporary, and part-time employment does not count toward fulfilling the one-year requirement. An employee must still be employed on the first day of class in order to be eligible for the tuition assistance waiver. Eligibility for dependent status is established on the first day of class; therefore, if an employee's dependent loses dependent status prior to the first day of class, they will not receive the tuition waiver even if previously approved. Eligible Courses: In-class and online courses as part of a degree program can be taken under tuition assistance. Only semester or term based courses fall under Tuition Assistance; independent studies and course auditing are not covered by this policy. Special and uniquely designed degree programs that have special-priced tuition rates such as Aviation programs and special priced cohort programs are not eligible for Employee/Dependent Tuition Assistance. Tuition assistance can only be used toward one degree at each level (one bachelor's degree, one master's degree, and one doctorate degree where available). If tuition assistance is utilized for any portion of a degree, it will not be granted for any portion of a second degree at the same level. Employees and dependents who have a higher level degree from any college or university are not eligible to pursue a lower level degree or equal level degree using Employee/Dependent Tuition Assistance, except for unique circumstances approved by the Chancellor. Academic Standing: In order to be eligible for tuition assistance, students must be in good academic standing. Good academic standing for the purposes of Tuition Assistance means that those eligible to receive Tuition Assistance must not be on any type of University “Hold” that would prevent them from being allowed to register for courses. If allowed to register for courses, and all other eligibility requirements are met, Tuition Assistance may be awarded. If the employee or dependent is registered in the semester or term and in a degree program, they are eligible for employee/dependent tuition assistance, unless ineligible for other policy reasons. Dropped courses/Withdraws: If a student drops or withdraws from courses that received a tuition waiver, it is the student's responsibility to immediately notify Human Resources so the waiver can be removed from the individuals account. If notification is not made until after the drop/add/withdrawal deadline date, the student is responsible for paying all tuition and fees for the courses. Failure to notify Human Resources of post drop/add date withdrawals and failure to pay the associated tuition will result in the employee or dependent being ineligible for further tuition assistance. If courses receiving waived tuition are failed, the tuition will not be waived for those courses a second time. Professional development/education courses: Courses taken by employees outside of a degree program and for professional development/education must be job related. These course fee waivers are charged to the employees department and therefore must be approved by the supervisor and funds must be available. Tuition amount waived: The rate of waiver is only up to the established, in-class, in-state tuition rate; all other costs and fees are the responsibility of the student and must be paid by established and published University deadlines. Failure of students to pay their fees and their portion of tuition will result in payment plan and late fees. The surcharge for distance learning (the amount charged over and above regular tuition) must be paid by the employee/dependent. Dependents of employees hired before September 30, 2015 receive a 75% waiver of eligible amounts for courses approved by their academic advisor. Dependents of employees hired on October 1, 2015 or later receive a 50% waiver of eligible amounts for courses approved by their academic advisor. After spring semester/T-4 Term 2020, all dependents of employees receive a 50% waiver of eligible amounts for courses approved by their academic advisor. Employees receive 100% waiver of eligible amounts for up to nine semester hours per academic year (usually one course each fall, spring, and summer semesters; supervisors can approve 2 courses in one semester or term if only one course is during business hours and the maximum number of hours are not exceeded for the academic year). For courses with an associated lab, the four credit hour course will be covered and calculated as a three hour course. Cap of Hours: Tuition waivers will be capped at 120 hours for undergraduate programs and 36 hours for graduate programs. Use of Waiver when other aid is received: Use of Waiver when other aid is received: If full, or partial, tuition is provided by any institutional/university source, then that source must be applied to tuition first, with tuition assistance being applied to the remaining balance. For example: If a full tuition payment is made by a Troy scholarship, tuition assistance would not apply. If you receive tuition assistance or reimbursements from other sources, such as federal loans, grants, G. I. Bills, or PACT payments - those sources will be applied to tuition after the tuition assistance is applied. Should the eligible participant's full tuition cease to be covered by another source for any reason while the participant is still eligible for Tuition Assistance, Tuition Assistance may be utilized at such time. Note: Employees must receive supervisor's approval to take courses during the business day and in such cases, extended work days should be arranged to ensure hours spent commuting and in class are worked at an alternate time. Under current tax laws (subject to change), employee and retiree undergraduate and up to $5,250 worth of graduate tuition assistance and dependent undergraduate tuition assistance are not considered taxable. Dependent graduate tuition assistance is considered 100% taxable income for the sponsoring employee or retiree and will be reported on the employee's IRS Form W-2 or on IRS Form 1099 for retirees. Payroll withholding taxes will be deducted from the employee's pay on the next pay period following the Semester/Term Census date (day after the final day to drop/add/withdraw without financial penalty). Applications for Tuition Assistance must route through the immediate supervisor. The form can be obtained using the links below and must be submitted to the Office of Human Resources after registration each academic term but prior to the 1st day of class. Eligibility requirements must be met for each term and must be established prior to the first day of class. Forms received after the first day of class will not be processed for tuition assistance unless approved by the applicable senior vice chancellor or athletics director due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

General Studies,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The General Studies program is an interdisciplinary program that prepares students to become effective communicators and critical thinkers who can speak, read, write and compute effectively. These skills represent those attributes essential for student academic and professional success. The General Studies program is divided into five separate areas: English Composition, Humanities/Fine Arts, Mathematics and Sciences, History/Social/Behavioral Sciences, and Pre-professional/Majors/Elective courses. The academic breadth of the General Studies program provides a critical foundation for future academic study for each TROY student, regardless of major. Exposure to this broad range of disciplines early in the student’s academic career stimulates student interest in previously unfamiliar areas and widens their intellectual horizons. The University regards the organization, composition, and diversity of General Studies program as evidence of its commitment to lifelong learning for its graduates. See General Studies Requirements for course offerings. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE GENERAL STUDIES PROGRAM The general studies program is an interdisciplinary program that educates and empowers students to become (1) effective written communicators and (2) critical thinkers. The operational definitions of these outcomes are taken from the Educational Testing Service materials which are part of their Proficiency Profile exam. The Proficiency Profile is used to assess student learning outcomes in writing, reading, critical thinking and mathematics. Expected Outcome: Effective Written CommunicatorsStudents will achieve measurable learning in the following ways: Expected Outcomes: Effective Critical Thinking (Critical Thinking, Reading, Mathematics)Students will achieve measurable learning in the following ways: Critical Thinking Reading Mathematics ASSESSMENT OF THE GENERAL STUDIES PROGRAMThe general studies program is assessed for college-level competencies at both the course level and the program level. Every general studies course is not individually assessed, but rather selected learning activities tied to broader learning contexts are assessed. A general studies course such as U.S. History assesses student learning on a variety of expected outcomes, including specific content for the course as well as the broader areas of reading and critical thinking. The course level assessment, in turn, supports the overall programmatic assessment of the general studies competencies. The programmatic assessment of the general studies program is discussed below. Proficiency Profile ExamsIn broad scope, the ETS Proficiency Profile is useful for assessing the general studies program at the program level. The Proficiency Profile is administered to rising juniors and is intended to assess the accumulation of competencies acquired over the duration of the general studies program. This test measures proficiency of academic skills such as reading, writing, critical thinking and mathematics in the context of the general studies program without assessing course-specific knowledge. The University regards the scope and diversity of its general studies program as preparing students to become effective communicators and critical thinkers who can read, write, and think logically and compute effectively. Use of the Proficiency Profile allows for general studies program programmatic assessments in Reading, Writing, Critical Thinking, and Mathematics. The Proficiency Profile is administered in a pre- and post- format with entering students taking the exam in their first semester and again after approximately 45-60 hours of earned credit. Proficiency StandardsTo assess whether the student can identify the conventions of standard written English using prose passages, the University uses the following Proficiency Goal: Fifty percent (50%) of students should score at or above the 50th percentile to achieve the desired proficiency level on the appropriate Proficiency Profile sections assessing written communication, critical thinking, reading and mathematics.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/general-studies/index.html

Instructional Leadership & Administration Courses (ILA),"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: *Prerequisite: Restricted to candidates who are admitted to a State of Alabama approved Instructional Leadership & Administration program. This course presents the skills and knowledge needed for effective school operation. Candidates will demonstrate their ability to promote the current and future success and well-being of each student and adult by applying best practices in management, communication, technology, school-level decision-making, and operation systems. The goal of the course is to improve candidate's ability to make data-informed and equitable educational resource allocations that comply with laws, policies and regulations. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. There are four spheres of influence, (home, neighborhood, community, and virtual) in which today's public schools exist. These arenas exert force upon the schools and at the same time are affected by the school. Because these environments are dynamic, they present school leadership with many challenges and an equal or greater number of opportunities. The purpose of this course is to show school leaders how to provide the resources that the stakeholders need in each of these arenas. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. Public schools are among the most regulated industries in the United States. Constitutional, Legislative, and Judicial mandates control everything from the length of the school day/year to who is qualified to teach. This course will examine the legal precedents that impact instructional leaders. Distinct attention will be given to special education law, Constitutional freedoms, personnel and civil law and to federal and state mandates related to student accountability. The candidate will need to understand how to manage uncertainty, risk, competent initiatives, and politics of change for continuous improvement. This course teaches students how to develop and administer systems that are fair and equitable management of conflict for the P12 student, faculty, staff, leaders, family, and community. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. Public schools are among the most regulated industries in the United States and to a certain degree so are the people who work in them. Holding educators to a higher standard than others should not come as a surprise. The primary focus of the course is how the leader serves as an ethical role model and decision-maker. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. The success or failure of the school largely depends on the effectiveness of its leader in defining a mission, a professional set of core values and the implementation of the vision. For this reason, increased attention is being placed upon the preparation of the school leader. This preparation includes not only the professional knowledge but the professional dispositions-ethics and core values necessary to successful leadership. With this in mind, leaders must be able to not only manage the physical plant but also create an environment where students can learn. This course will provide program completers with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead a 21st century school but also give them tools and processes critical to the development of a mission, vision, and core values that will insure high-quality instruction and increased learning. In addition, the course will examine the strategies that are critical to continuous improvement. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. From a budgetary perspective, the most important aspects of education are those things, which get the most funding. In a typical budget, personnel (salaries and retirement) receive about 80% of the expenditures. This course will deal with the selection, staffing and development of all school personnel. Special attention will be given to the legal issues relating to human resource management. The candidate will learn how to establish a professional culture driven by a shared vision, goals and objectives for the well-being of every student while setting high expectations, ethical, and equitable practices, collaboration, integrity, and continuous improvement. Using collaborative practices and professional feedback, the candidate will examine the applicability of roles, trends, and research in order to improve the execution of strategic plans for managing staff resources related to school improvement and student learning. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. According to recent demographic predictions, the American classroom will continue to increase in diversity. According to some estimates, within the next 20 years ethnic minorities will become the majority. To succeed in this changing world, instructional leaders must be prepared to lead a diverse learning environment. This course will provide instructional leadership candidates with the skills, abilities, dispositions, and strategies to foster learning environments where all children including those with special needs, can experience success. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. Which instructional practices support the highest gains in student achievement? If one reads the publicity associated with new programs, they all do! How is the busy instructional leader to know how to separate the genuine instructional practice from the fad? This course examines the current research that supports student learning and engagement. In order for instructional leaders to promote effective learning environments, they must be able to understand, identify, and apply effective learning theories, research-based instructional strategies and methodologies. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. This course is a review of assessment strategies. It will include statistical processes used in data analysis. Various standardized tests and measurement procedures will be analyzed. Test construction and interpretation of teacher-made tests will be a prominent part of the course. Particular importance will be given to research-based intervention strategies. Candidates should expect to spend some hours in clinically related activities as part of this course. The purpose of this course is to provide instructional leadership candidates with an opportunity to lead school-based experiences at the elementary, middle, secondary grade levels for a period of 10 consecutive days.

PIs must also guard against coercing participation or even the appearance of coercion. The informed consent process helps address these issues. This should be considered as an ongoing process, and questions from research participants must be answered at any time during the research study. Also, PIs must immediately inform participants of any new information that may affect the research risks or requirements. A main component of the informed consent process is the informed consent document. This document is required for all research studies involving human subjects. In any research where a participant's identity or identifying information will be recorded (including on ""coded"" lists accessible only to the PI), the signature of the participants verifying that they have read the informed consent document and agree to participate in the study must be obtained by the Principal Investigator. In addition, participants must be given copies of the informed consent documents to keep. In research where the PI assures participants anonymity, in which a signed informed consent document would be the only object linking a participant to the research study, written informed consent should not be collected. Instead, the document should be either read (in the case of telephone interviews) or provided to the participant to read before data are collected. In the case of web-based studies, the informed consent document should be on the initial screen that the participant sees. The participant should be able to indicate by clicking one of two buttons: Principal Investigators of research studies involving children or individuals with impaired decision-making capabilities must receive written informed consent from parents or legally authorized representatives.

Protect the Autoimmune,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Our campaign is an awareness campaign created to bring attention to at-risk students on campus and at-risk people in our community.

Robert Kruckeberg,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: On December 27, 2020, our friend, colleague, and professor Robert Kruckeberg passed away after a brief illness. From the time of his diagnosis until his passing, he got married, became a father, and took care of his family, even as they took care of him. “ I recently (January 2025) reached out to Dr. Kruckeberg because I missed him and wanted to begin a dialogue with him about things I thought he would find interesting. I didn't know about his passing and I felt profound grief for him and shame for not knowing. I just wanted to share with you a few things about him that made me excited for class with him. I was a STEM major, and Dr. Kruckeberg was my western civ 1 and 2 teacher. Over the course of conversation in class, he found out I was Catholic and I became the first hand authority about anything regarding the Catholic faith, even though I reiterated each time that I was a bad Catholic and not worthy of being the authority. As you can imagine, Catholicism came up frequently in a western civ class. He thought I was being modest and would still ask me what I thought about certain moments in European history involving Catholicism. It made me feel important and kept me engaged, and a lot of the time the class would laugh at our back and forth. Beyond that, he made me feel like he valued my opinion- he would frequently ask my thoughts on a wide range of topics during lecture including science and current events. At one point he asked me to explain general relativity (I was a freshman and completely ignorant on the subject) and I said I don't know, something about Einstein and e=mc^2 and he gave me a little chuckle and politely moved on without embarrassing me. As my education and career have progressed, this moment pops into my head more than I'd like to admit, but he was learned enough to know I had no idea what I was talking about and polite enough to not embarrass me in front of my peers. This instance is what I emailed him about recently, to thank him for not embarrassing me and to acknowledge that I had no idea what I was talking about. I wanted to tell him that I am knowledgeable enough to explain general relativity to him now if he was willing to give me a ""do-over"". I thought he would get a kick out of it. I wish we could have that conversation. Anyways, I find myself in a state of profound grief and shame at finding out about his passing. He was a great teacher. I hated every other non STEM class I took because it felt like a waste of my time and money, but not his class. What he taught me was how to analyze things I read, how to understand the motivations behind people's actions and behavior, and how to transform a lot of information into a clean narrative. These skills have transcended simple history class and are skills I use every day. I am profoundly sad that he passed. My child was born while I was in his class. He was the first professor I told. He helped me navigate the anxieties and doubt of those first few weeks and showed me that I am a capable and competent person and alleviated my fears and anxieties. I wish I could thank him. He was a great man and my favorite professor even as a STEM student. ” “ I only took one class with Kruck but that was enough to collect stories I'll probably tell forever. I took history of western thought a couple of years ago. I remember the debate I went through during registration: my two choices were bioethics...at a time like 2 PM, or western thought with Kruck at 8:30 AM. I am, as you probably know, a confirmed night owl and so wasn't eager for the early start, but it was that or discuss organs...so there I was. I got up at 7:30 AM every Tuesday and Thursday for months to discuss the dry, often nonsensical writings of dead white male philosophers, and the only reason it was all worth it was Kruck. That experience was one of the big clues that I needed to change my major; there was one particular day early in the semester when I woke up to the noxious tones of my alarm and thought, ""God, I just don't want to get up. This bed is way too soft and warm. I know it's cold outside too."" But then I thought, ""well, I did really want to discuss that Francis Bacon reading."" And so I did. ” B.A., University of North Texas, 1999 Ph.D., University of Michigan, 2009 Old Regime France, Eighteenth-Century Europe, the Enlightenment, French Revolution, and the Atlantic World Robert Kruckeberg was Associate Professor of History at TROY University and received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2009. He came to Troy in the fall of 2012, and remained a dedicated colleague, professor, and friend until his passing at the end of 2020. Before coming to TROY , he taught at the University of Mississippi, Alfred University, and Kalamazoo College. He was working on a book manuscript titled The Wheel of Fortune in Eighteenth-Century France: The Lottery, Economic Change, and Political Transformation. This project examined the development of lotteries in France during the eighteenth century from small charitable lotteries to the largest state run lottery Europe had ever known in the Royal Lottery. The project used the lotteries to examine the intersection between political and economic transformation that preceded the French Revolution in 1789 and continued on during the Revolution itself. More broadly, he was interested in the rise of modern financial capitalism and its connection with the rise of modern political culture. Western Civilization I and II French Revolution and Napoleon Early Modern France Age of Absolutism Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment The Caribbean Modern European Intellectual and Cultural History Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe “Kruck's irreverent teaching style meant that I felt completely comfortable walking into the class and starting the discussion with ""what the hell was that??"" He was always ready and willing to talk about how downright weird the reading was. Our discussion experience was supplemented by lectures, which also included just how weird the authors were. My friends and I could be ourselves with him, engaging with the class in the way we did best: by saying stupid stuff. Other teachers did not always appreciate this approach, but it was Kruck's modus operandi as far as I know.”",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-arts-sciences/departments/history-philosophy-department/faculty-staff/kruckeberg.html

Surveying and Geomatics Sciences,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Do you excel in math and science? Are you interested in computers, the latest technology and the environment? If your answer is “yes,” then a Troy University bachelor's degree in surveying and geomatics sciences may be the perfect fit for you. TROY is home to the only ABET-accredited surveying and geomatics sciences program in Alabama and one of the few in the southeastern United States. Our program boasts a 100% job placement rate. In fact, our students typically have multiple job offers before they graduate. Your land surveying degree can be adjusted to meet your specific needs and interests in geomatics. Get the flexibility you need by taking courses in class or through a blend of both online and in-class. For more information about program availability and delivery options, call 1-800-414-5756. Through TROY'S surveying and geomatics sciences program, you'll be prepared to play a fundamental role in designing and constructing buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water-supply systems and utilities. You could also go on to create computer systems for land management, resource management, utility organization, traffic control and urban planning — or put your TROY education to work helping less developed countries change their land ownership systems and promote economic growth and democracy. Our program is approved by the Alabama Board of Licensure for Engineers and Land Surveyors, so you can be assured your TROY degree can lead you to a career as a licensed land surveyor in Alabama. To become a professional licensed land surveyor, you must apply through the Alabama Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. For more information, visit bels.alabama.gov. With TROY's bachelor's degree in surveying and geomatics sciences, you'll be well-positioned for surveying jobs with leading surveying and engineering companies. Most of our geomatics graduates start as survey crew chiefs or surveying technicians and proceed to positions like project manager or surveying manager. Several have started their own survey companies. The subdiscipline of land surveying is an ancient science dating back to the first need to delineate land ownership on the ground. The need for land boundaries or cadastral surveyors is just as important today. In fact, one could argue that as human population grows, the demand for the fixed quantity of land on the earth surface increases. As land values increase, the need for the accurate determination of land boundaries becomes even more important. Many geomatics professionals assist in the design and construction of roads, bridges, subdivisions and planned unit developments. Areas of interest are planning and zoning, the principles of route surveying, hydrology, large-scale mapping, subdivisions design and CAD drafting. Students are offered the opportunity to study land development in GEM 4405 Route and Construction Surveying, GEM L407 Land Development Lab and GEM 4409 Hydrology. Topographic mapping is studied in GEM 3330 Advanced Measurement Analysis and GEM L405 Route and Construction Surveying Lab. GEM 4409 is a design course focused on the determination of peak flows and design of hydraulic flows to accommodate runoff. An exciting integration of land development and GIS is offered by new software that offers parcel management features. Career opportunities exist for geomatics professionals in construction surveying, subdivision design and layout, and land information systems (GIS). Least squares is a statistical criterion for the estimation of the goodness of fit in correlation analysis. Least squares methods aim to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observations and the predictions from a model. Least squares is a method for determining the line that comes nearest to passing through a set of data points. The squares come in because of Pythagoras' theorem about triangles. The method aims to minimize (hence the word “least”) the sum of the differences from the data points to the line in question. Least squares is a mathematical optimization technique that attempts to find a “best fit” to a set of data by attempting to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences (called residuals) between the fitted function and the data. Geodesy is the study of the size, shape and the effect of the physical properties of the earth on measurements. A mathematical model of the earth is the subject of geometric geodesy, the earth's gravity field is the subject of physical geodesy, and the use of earth satellites to measure the earth's surface is the concern of satellite geodesy. The civilian use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a major component of the study of geodesy. GPS plays a valuable role in providing precise measurements between receivers on the earth's surface based on one-way signals broadcast from a network of satellites. Study of the models used by GPS systems to determine precise coordinate locations and the transformation of these initial coordinates to facilitate the accomplishment of local geomatics projects is a major portion of the course work in GEM 3370 Geodesy and Geodetics. GPS is a complex system that is easy to use. However, to understand the system itself, one needs to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves (microwaves), the properties of the atmosphere, the orbits of the satellites and the impact of solar radiation, the concept of precise timing, the ellipsoid model used as a reference system for GPS measurements, transformations between coordinate systems and the principles of least squares adjustment. Construction surveying is the translation of construction plans into physical points on the ground that can be used as a basis for the actual construction. The results of construction surveying are seen in almost any urban, suburban and even rural setting. Almost any roadway, building, or other man-made improvement probably had some amount of construction surveying involved. Construction surveying provides not only the horizontal location of new improvements but also the vertical information required to ensure that surfaces drain or pipes flow as required. The stakes and points set during the process of construction surveying are not usually set at the actual construction point, but usually on some sort of offset. This is done so that the survey stake is not disturbed by excavation or other activities that will take place at the actual point of construction. The stakes are marked with an “offset” and a “grade,” which provides the construction crew with the spatial relationship of the construction stake to the actual point of construction. The “offset” is the distance from the survey stake to the horizontal position of the actual point of construction and would typically be three feet for curb and gutter to 10 feet for underground pipes. The distance of the offset should be coordinated with the contractor to accommodate any specific needs due to existing field conditions or special equipment and should be clearly marked on the survey stake (usually by a number enclosed in a circle). The “grade” represents the change in elevation that needs to be obtained from the reference point to the actual construction point, expressed as a “cut” (lower in elevation) or a “fill” (higher in elevation). The grade should also indicate the vertical feature that the grade is referencing, usually a flow line or finished floor elevation. The need for accuracy is inherent in all of the surveyor's tasks but is especially evident in construction surveying. It is not only important to perform all calculations correctly but also to communicate clearly with the contractor about the distance of offsets and reference points for grades. If the surveyor provides grades to the flow line of curb and gutter and the contractor uses those grades as top-of-curb elevation, the net result is a construction site that is not going to work as planned! Additionally, scheduling should be coordinated in a manner that minimizes the risk of the stakes being damaged by human or natural activities, as any disturbance to the survey stake may carry over to actual construction. (http://www.flatsurv.com/) The U.S. National Map Program providing full map coverage of the continental United States was made possible by the development of the theory and practice of photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is the science of obtaining measurements from photographs. Today the importance of photogrammetry has not diminished as the most effective method of providing precise spatial data over large project sites. The pressing need for precise spatial data for geographic information systems makes the field of photogrammetry an exciting area to study. Students are taught the fundamentals of photogrammetry with an emphasis on being able to apply photogrammetry in a practical way to all types of surveying and mapping problems. TROY has made an investment in leading-edge imaging software to allow students to use computers to view photography, perform image enhancement, set up stereo models and to produce orthophotos to use as maps. Our students are taught how to perform aerial flight planning to ensure the photography and control necessary to meet specific project data accuracy requirements. Students are exposed to the following technology: GIS is an application that can benefit from the input of a team of interdisciplinary professionals. A geomatics professional is a valuable member of a GIS team when the mapping data is required to be precise such as the base map for county land ownership or utility location. Applications requiring precise data typically use photogrammetry and survey-grade GPS receivers to acquire the data. The ability to determine the procedures and equipment necessary to acquire a specification for precise data is one of the benefits from study in our geomatics program. GIS is a major component of our surveying and geomatics sciences program. You'll be offered two courses on the fundamentals and application of GIS. GIS applications are introduced in the curriculum to demonstrate the impact that GIS is and will continue to make on your career in geomatics. Simply put, a GIS combines layers of information about a place to give you a better understanding of that place. One of the main benefits of GIS is improved management of your organization and resources. A GIS can link data sets together by common locational data, such as addresses, which helps departments and agencies share their data. By creating a shared database, one department can benefit from the work of another. Troy University's Surveying and Geomatics Sciences program is one of seven in the nation to be honored with the Surveying Education Award by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).",https://www.troy.edu/academics/academic-programs/surveying-geomatics-sciences-program.html

In the past few years, there have been a number of new monolayer materials systems that have attracted significant interest, including graphene (monolayer carbon), silicine (monolayer silicon), germanene (monolayer germaium), and stanene (monolayer tin), black and blue phosphorous, and dichalcogenicdes (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2), among a rapidly growing list of materials. These materials, however, are heavily disorder-dominated systems with measured electron mobility of ≪1000 cm2 V-1 s-1 that can be largely associated with the extrinsic properties (defects, surface adsorption, and other lattice imperfections). The modulation doped gallium arsenide two-dimensional electron gas has seen extensive study and the growth of high quality samples with mobilities exceeding 106 cm2 V-1 s, which provides a model system to study the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional materials in the “clean” limit. Ultrafast spectroscopic techniques are a frequently employed and powerful technique that is used to unravel complex and often competing processes in condensed matter systems on a femtosecond time scale. These study a wide range of excitations over the electromagnetic spectrum from the terahertz to the x-ray with subpicosecond time resolution. These results will be needed for future electronics design in these materials. In this talk, I will discuss our work using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to study Landau level populations and coherences in high mobility two-dimensional semiconducting systems. We model our results using the Optical Bloch Equations to determine the dephasing lifetime as a function of temperature and explain our low temperature results using ionized impurity and bound interface charge scattering in the conducting layer. In the second part of my talk, I will discuss our recent work to study these materials in high magnetic field using the 25 Tesla Split-Florida Helix magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Lab. Our results reveal a complex interplay between conventional (electron transport) and complex (many-body) electronic interaction on an extremely fast time scale.This work has been funded by NSF CAREER (2DEG Materials Physics, DMR-1056827) and the Department of Energy/Basic Energy Sciences (Instrument Development, DE-SC0012635). Additional funding for graduate students working on these projects comes from the Department of Education GAANN (P200A090143). A portion of this work was performed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, which is supported by National Science Foundation Cooperative Agreement No. DMR-1157490 and the state of Florida. This work was performed, in part, at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, a U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences user facility.After Dr. Hilton’s talk, he is interested in talking to students with interest in attending graduate school. In addition to recruiting for UAB’s program, he has been affiliated with a number of different programs in his career and would be willing to talk about gradate school admission requirements, how to choose a school, what to look for in a thesis advisor and project, and what future jobs are available. Dave Hilton received B.S. (1997) and M.S. (1999) degrees in Optics from the University of Rochester. He received a M.S. (2001) and Ph.D. (2002) in Applied Physics from Cornell University. From 2002 to 2006, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where his research focus shifted to terahertz spectroscopy of correlated electronic systems. From 2006 to 2007, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University, where his interests included the development of novel spectroscopic measurement techniques for high-resolution spectroscopy in high magnetic fields. He joined the faculty as Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2013. His research program focuses on the study of insulator-to-metal phase transitions in transition metal oxides and ultrafast investigations of high mobility 2DEGs and dichalcogenides.

The universe is a giant laboratory that allows us to explore nature in conditions far more extreme than can be produced on Earth. It is the most fundamental of all sciences and the most all-encompassing. In addition, our understanding of the universe is expanding at an exponential rate. Yet astronomy is also the most democratic of sciences. Its beauty and its wonder are open to all, and not just the scientist using giant telescopes. Examples of research opportunities with modest equipment are presented as are important discoveries by non-scientists through Citizen Science projects.

Then, both living and lifeless systems should obey the same laws of physics. In other words, we should be able to explain how living systems work using physics alone. However, we are not sure if the currently known laws and principles of physics are sufficient to explain the life. We are still far from being able to answer this question since we haven't explained much of the biological processes with physics yet. In order to discover a possible new physics, we need to try to explain the whole of living systems with the present physics. In this talk, I will try to introduce several interesting processes in biological cells which physicists are trying to explain using the known laws of physics, including molecular motors driven by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, photosynthesis that harvests sun light using quantum tunneling and coherence, and avian magnet compass which may be utilizing quantum entangled states. These examples, which are not fully understood yet, show that the life perhaps knows graduate level physics or above.

Dr. David King Monday, February 27 4:00-5:00 p.m.MSCX -Room 114 About 84 million years ago, central Alabama was situated at the shoreline of the northern Gulf of Mexico. A warm, equitable climate prevailed and the age of dinosaurs was in full swing. A small asteroid perhaps 300 to 350 m in diameter penetrated the atmosphere and shallow ocean waters of central Alabama and detonated nearly a kilometer into the crust. The rim and floor of this impact crater have stood the test of time and are still present today as an area of highly disturbed geology in Elmore County, less than 20 minutes drive from downtown Montgomery. The crater is asymmetrical and is horseshoe-shaped, ranging in size from 4.5 to 7.6 km across. Suggestions that this unusual structure might be an impact crater began in the 1970s following a state survey mapping campaign in the area. However, proof of impact in the form of shocked minerals and traces of cosmic elements like iridium was lacking until a core-drilling campaign was undertaken in 1998, which was led by me. In 1999-2000 we documented unequivocal evidence of shocked mineral grains (quartz) and traces of cosmic elements from the impactor (iridium, plus Cr, Co, and Ni). This resulted in a 2002 paper in Earth and Planetary Science Letters that laid out the evidence and thus established Wetumpka as a bona fide impact crater within in the impact-crater community. Further research has established the role of sea water in the crater modification process. We have subsequently documented evidence of aqueous mass movements and muddy tsunami flows in the crater and vicinity.

Dr. Luther Beegle October 16th, 2014 3:00-4:00 p.m. MSCX – Room 114 Abstract: The Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC) investigation was recently selected for the Mars 2020 integrated payload. The Mars 2020 rover has two main objectives: In Situ Analysis of samples to determine the geological, chemical and potential for biology in a sample and 2) To collect and cache samples of high scientific interest to return to earth for analysis in a terrestrial laboratory. SHERLOC enables non-contact, spatially resolved, and highly sensitivity detection and characterization of organics and minerals in the Martian surface and near subsurface. SHERLOC is an arm-mounted, Deep UV (DUV) resonance Raman and fluorescence spectrometer utilizing a 248.6-nm DUV laser which induces fluorescence in aromatic organic molecules present in a sample . SHERLOC's deep UV resonance Raman enables detection and classification of aromatic and aliphatic organics with sensitivities of 10^-2 to below 10^-4 w/w at greater than 50 µm spatial scales. In addition to organics, the deep UV Raman enables detection and classification of minerals relevant to aqueous chemistry with grain sizes below 20 µm grains. The instrument goals are to assess past aqueous history, detect the presence and preservation of potential biosignatures, and to support selection of return samples. To do this, SHERLOC will measure CHNOPS-containing mineralogy, measure the distribution and type of organics preserved at the surface, and correlate them to textural features.

Philosophy and Religion Minor,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” (Socrates) Philosophy explores the most fundamental questions of human existence. This exploration involves the careful analysis of complex concepts and the evaluation and construction of arguments. By engaging in philosophical inquiries, students can enhance their cognitive abilities and gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. Examples of philosophical questions include: Philosophy is incredibly practical. The skills honed through the study of philosophy, including critical thinking, problem-solving, effective communication, persuasive writing, and sound argumentation, can be seamlessly applied across various career fields, such as law, business, information technology, government service, education, medicine, and the ministry. For more information about the marketable value of philosophy in a rapidly changing economy, see What You Can Do With a Philosophy Degree and Philosophy: A Brief Guide for Undergraduates. TROY’s Philosophy and Religion minor has been instrumental in helping many students gain acceptance into various graduate programs, including Harvard University, the Penn State Law School, the University of Washington Law School, Southern University Law Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the UCLA Medical School. Please check Student Testimonials to learn more about how this popular minor has positively impacted our students’ career paths. Philosophy also provides a strong preparation for graduate and professional schools. Philosophy students consistently have the highest mean composite scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), the highest average scores on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), and outperform most majors, including business, on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).

The Unexpected Way Philosophy Majors Are Changing The World Of Business The Value of Philosophy in Entrepreneurship Why Future Business Leaders Need Philosophy Legendary hedge fund investor attributes his success to studying philosophy “Minoring in philosophy directly benefitted me when it came time to take the LSAT—which was a huge factor in my success in law school applications. Many of the skills I learned in philosophy classes transferred into critical thinking and practical analysis of arguments both in the LSAT as well as in every other class at Troy. Because of the philosophy minor, I am a much better debater and critical thinker than I would have been otherwise!” “ Dr. Lim not only helped me realize what my ethical beliefs are, but he taught me how to hold polite and civil discussions about touchy issues. And Dr. Valentine not only provided me with a baseline for my belief system, but helped me to understand others on their terms – evaluating their arguments from a stance of compassion, not just trying to win. For anyone who enjoys critical thinking, for anyone who wants to be more informed about our moral reasoning, for anyone at all, actually!- I would highly recommend Troy University’s Philosophy minor. ” “ Studying philosophy is the perfect minor for curious minds. All of my philosophy classes served as mini vacations classes for me in a day full of copying down notes. I was able to exercise a different part of my brain and linking my personal experiences to the readings…. Finding out that studying philosophy strengthens critical thinking skills was a plus for me knowing I would soon be attending graduate school. Also, with medical school still open as an option ethics class caused me to think about the hard questions in our medical communities. ” Joungbin Lim (Ph.D., University of Virginia) Jay Valentine (Ph.D., University of Virginia) “The classes that are offered in this minor forced us as students to formulate our own opinions and to think of opposing scenarios that could help in future occupations. Critical Thinking was the first class that I took under this minor and from the first day I genuinely wanted to learn more. Both professors that I took, Dr. Joungbin Lim and Dr. Jay Valentine, shared valuable information through their coursework and cared for the success of each student that was in their classes. If you want to be able to enhance your thinking skills and take a deeper look into various philosophical topics, then this is the minor for you.” Rick Garlikov (ABD, University of Michigan) Academic Catalog An upbeat introduction to the major classical sources of political thought and the application of these sources to contemporary political issues in a manner to transcends political divisions. Testimonials“Joining the Philosophy and Religion Minor at Troy was one of the best decisions I have made (thanks Dr. Valentine for persuading me my first semester). Throughout the program and classes offered by Dr. Lim and Dr. Valentine, I have learned more than I thought was capable in my undergraduate studies. Especially with pursuing a career in law, my eyes have been opened to necessary critical thinking strategies and I have learned how to handle arguments not only academically, but personally as well. Thanks to Dr. Lim too, I have found some dual programs that I wouldn’t have known about otherwise that will help expand my career even further. This minor is definitely one of the hidden gems on campus that needs to grow and expand so more can find and experience these amazing opportunities.” Melanie Ford, Psychology and English Major, Philosophy and Religion Minor “Rather than changing my worldview, the philosophy minor allowed me to critically explore my personal beliefs on personhood and religion. Additionally, the in-class discourses on various ethical and metaphysical topics gave me practice in logically presenting my viewpoints and also exposed me to the perspectives of my classmates and other great thinkers. Quite frankly, I retained a higher proportion of the lessons I obtained from my philosophy minor than my biomedical science major. Skills I improved through this minor such as analytical thinking or problem solving have been transferable to my post-graduate work with my master's degree and now med school. I would encourage all students, particularly those in science majors, to consider picking up this minor or at least taking more philosophy courses.” Abena Adaboh, Biomedical Science Major and Philosophy and Religion Minor ""The Philosophy and Religion program at Troy provided me with the resources and skills to pursue my goals. The training in analytic thought and formal logic I received aided me in achieving a 165 on the GRE verbal section. The education in Buddhist theology I received aided me in receiving a fully-funded year-long scholarship to study philosophy and religion in Beijing, China. These experiences (among others) provided me the means to submit a competitive application to MA programs at the University of Alabama, Florida State University, and Harvard University. I was offered full funding at all three schools, and I know that I would not have advanced in my career in this way without my experiences in the Philosophy and Religion minor, which prepared me for the next stage of my academic journey."" Charles Taylor, History Major and Philosophy and Religion Minor ""Coming into my Junior year at TROY University, I was still undecided on a minor as nothing had yet really captivated my attention when I had taken courses for different fields of study. That semester the university hired two new professors to reform the Philosophy section of the Department of History and Philosophy. Having sat in on both of these new professors interview lectures, I knew I had found something fun, new, and challenging. This led me to sign up for the minor and begin exploring what classes there were to take. Each class in the minor was something new to me, and the professors expertise guided the classes smoothly while making sure each student had a challenge they could conquer. From Ethics to Logic and from Politics to Religion there is a class for any area of philosophy a student might be interested in, and I can promise you won't be disappointed."" Jeremy Burgess, History Major and Philosophy and Religion Minor ""Intro to Philosophy was the first class that I took where I wasn't challenged to memorize information but I was challenged to actually think for myself. After that class I started reading Ancient Greek philosophy. At first, I was just intrigued, but that quickly turned into a full-blown addiction. I couldn't get enough; my inquisitive mind yearned for more. I immediately declared a philosophy minor. It changed the way I think and observe the world around me, I think differently about problems and interactions. So, it is hard to give just one example of where I use philosophy in my daily life. I have been forever changed by my philosophical education, Dr. Lim and Dr. Valentine are deeply compassionate about the department and the program at TROY. The knowledge I gained from them is immeasurable and I would not be who I am today without it. I guess a better way to say it might be, that everything I do and say are examples of how I use philosophy in my daily life."" Justin Wooten, Theatre Major and Philosophy Minor ""If you want to learn how to think take a philosophy class. I took my first philosophy class my junior year. After being in class a couple of days I knew I wanted to take more classes so I added philosophy as a minor. I enjoyed the way philosophy classes challenged my worldview. It also equipped be to tackle tough questions and arguments. I believe everyone can benefit for these types of classes. Philosophy classes are also especially helpful for those wanting to pursue law school. I took the LSAT and concepts and skills needed to do well on the test are also taught in philosophy classes."" Cassidy Counter, Economics Major and Philosophy Minor ""I enjoyed taking classes like Logic, Critical Thinking, and Ethics with Dr. Lim, which emphasized on logical reasoning and the study of metaphysics and epistemology. Dr. Valentine’s classes were equally fun for their in-depth analysis of non-western religions and philosophies. Skills like critical thinking, analytical writing, problem-solving, and argument deconstruction that I had acquired through the Philosophy Minor greatly helped me get a good score in the GRE that I took in my senior year. As a result, I got accepted into multiple doctoral programs at prominent research universities in the country. I plan on using the skills that philosophy has taught me to succeed in my graduate education and beyond into a scientific career."" Abishek Ghimire, Biomedical Sciences Major and Philosophy and Religion Minor ""The classes have helped me reevaluate my beliefs and helped me refine my world view….The skills through classes such as Ethics, Logic, and Critical Thinking have helped me detect the fallacies from the point of view I held and offered clarity. Not limited to that, the classes on Non-Western Philosophies and other selected topics involving religion have helped me to understand how people who are unlike me in terms of their conditioning think. This has been very interesting and helpful in understanding people of different cultures. Troy has to offer the philosophy and religion major that I can confidently assert, is a fantastic way for a person to embark on the journey of clarity and self-exploration, apart from other perks in professional growth.""

Freshman Forum,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Freshman Forum is the freshman branch of the Student Government Association. We are here to help the freshman leaders get connected around the TROY campus, in the community, and begin making lifelong friendships. Freshman Forum is made up of approximately 50 freshman and 2 directors. The members of Freshman Forum had to go through an application and interview process. Once the new members are chosen, they will go on a retreat to learn parliamentary procedure, leadership skills, and team work. It also provides the chance for you to get to know you colleagues. Just like any other organization, Freshman Forum is made up of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and other non-executive officers. The directors are there to help the executive officers and members get everything done on the agenda and act as mentors to the freshmen. APPLY FOR FRESHMAN FORUM Hometown: Destin, FL Major: Global Business Marketing Classification: Sophomore Why I chose TROY: I get this question a lot, especially being that I am an out-of-state student. When I was searching for colleges in my junior year of high school, I had originally planned to attend a Florida school. I did not want to be too far from home because I knew I would miss the beach too much. Then I came across Troy and decided to do some more research. I quickly became intrigued with all that I saw online and asked my parents to drive me up for a tour. During my tour, I fell in love with the campus and truly felt at home. The staff was so attentive and showed me that Troy really was the perfect fit for me. We also learned the amazing scholarship opportunities Troy has to offer, which made it possible for me to attend Troy! Involvement and Honors at TROY: My proudest accomplishment of my freshman year was being a 2023-2024 Freshman Forum delegate. I served on the Public Relations committee and had the great honor of receiving the first Barbara Patterson Leadership Award. I am also a member of Alpha Gamma Delta sorority and Student Alumni Association. Words of Encouragement: My favorite line and best advice about starting freshman year: College is what you make it! Get as involved as you can, meet as many people as possible, and make connections that will last a lifetime. Do not be afraid to be outgoing because you will find the people that make life so much sweeter! Through Freshman Forum, I met my absolute best friends that I cannot imagine living life without! Hometown: Cullman, AL Major: Global Business Management Classification: Sophomore Why I chose TROY: My first time on Campus was the summer leading up to my senior year in high school. I came to Troy for 85th American Legion Alabama Boys State. The moment I stepped on campus, I knew Troy was the school I wanted to attend. Coming from a small town, I knew I wanted to attend a University that was similar. Troy is a great place if you are looking for smaller classes and building relationships with professors. I can honestly say that coming to Troy was one of the best decisions I have ever made! Involvement and Honors at TROY: During my Freshman year, one of my biggest accomplishments was being named to the Fall 2023 Provost's List. This achievement is given to students who had at least 3.65 GPA for the Fall semester. During my time in Freshman Forum, I was named the 2023-2024 Excellence in Leadership Conference Director. I am currently a member of FarmHouse Fraternity and serve as the Vice-President of Recruitment for the Student Alumni Association. Words of Encouragement: My advice would be to get out of your comfort zone. College is really about getting to meet new people and try new things. Coming into college, I had no intention of joining Freshman Forum or Greek Life, but I can confidently say both organizations have made my time at Troy enjoyable. The experience that you will have at Troy is all about what you make it! The Troy Leadership Conference is Freshman Forum's marquee event, as our delegates host leaders from high schools across the Southeast. The participants attend interesting and innovative seminars on topics ranging anywhere from managing stress to building resumes. Students that attend are given a glimpse of what life is like as a Trojan and leave the conference equipped with top-notch leadership skills.

EPP Data 2020-21,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University’s College of Education is committed as an Education Preparation Provider (EPP) to prepare and develop informed, innovative, reflective, globally-minded and effective professional teacher candidates. Candidate performance is carefully monitored at various milestones during their program to promote positive student learning outcomes. Troy University’s College of Education, in accordance with our various accreditation and assessment measures, seek to demonstrate our candidates’ accountability and provide transparent data concerning student performance. This is facilitated not only by our academic excellence in the areas of educator preparation for licensure, but is enhanced further by many hours of clinical field experience within a diverse range of schools and educational institutions. Programs in the Department of Teacher Education are accredited through various organizations. College of Education Department of Teacher Education Undergraduate and Initial Certification Programs are accredited through the following: Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) reviewed and fully accredited all programs except the music programs National Association of Schools of Music reviewed and full accredited the Music Education Programs. TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATESFall 2020-Spring 2021 Total number of Program Completers in Traditional and Alt A Total Number of Program Completers ALT-A GRADUATESFall 2019-Spring 2020 Total Number of Program Completers Alt-A Total Number of Program Completers Alt-A Data must address: (a) completer impact in contributing to P-12 student-learning growth AND (b) completer effectiveness in applying professional knowledge, skills, and dispositions. On the Follow-Up Survey for Graduates, the question to request completers to share pre- and post-test data to show the impact on P-12 learning received 17 volunteers. However, of the five volunteers who submitted information, only two of the five volunteers submitted pre- and post-test data. Because the response rate was so low, the EPP reached out to school systems. We currently have one school system providing progress monitoring data for the 2020-2021 year of students in completer classrooms. In order to ensure no personal identifiable information is revealed the school system is working with the company to provide the data linked to the program (ECE, ELE, SEC-Math, etc.) We continue to reach out to completers to provide either progress monitoring data or pre-and post-test data. Now that school is consistently in-person and no longer vacillating between in-person, virtual and blended, teachers are back into one routine. Therefore, we think completers will send the requested data before the end of school this year. From the two volunteers, the data shows all students showed learning growth from the pre-test to the post-test. Although this is an extremely small number, we plan to update this chart with additional data to show impact on P-12 learning during the Summer of 2022. Elementary Music Aggregated mean Pre-test Mean Range 53% 0-89 61% 26-92 57% 0-92 Post-test Mean Range 75.2% 70-99 100% 100 87.6% 70-100 Mean % of growth;increase from pre- to post-test The data from the two Troy University completers consisted of a pre-and post-assessments. They administered a pre-assessment, taught the lesson, and then completed a post-assessment which was the same as the pre-assessment. The variable between the pre-test and the post-test was the instruction provided to students by the completer. The average score for the pre-assessment was 57%. The average score for the post-assessment was 87.6%. The impact on student learning indicated a 30.61% average gain from pre- to post-assessment and 100% of the students increased their learning growth. We expect additional data to be submitted by the end of the school year. Focus Group Interview Four individuals agreed to participate, one ELE major, two Collab K-6 majors and one double major of Collab K-6 and ELE. Although this is a very small group and does not represent all programs, it provided a deeper understanding of the impact completers have on P-12 student-learning growth. These completers were candid, providing suggestions to improve the program and commending faculty and instructional practices that helped them to positively impact student learning. However, when they were asked how they know they have a positive impact on P-12 student learning, they provided anecdotal stories of learning growth for specific students who were below grade level and how they made great gains to reach benchmark or almost reaching benchmark. They also indicated that the scores on their progress monitoring tests show students have increased in learning, even if by 2 points, which showed growth in student learning. These interviewees agreed to send progress monitoring data before the end of school. 2021 FOLLOW-UP SURVEY FOR GRADUATES 44.44% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded believe Very Well to Extremely Well that they are prepared to impact P-12 student learning. This may be due to the pandemic with schools changing from in-person to virtual to blended multiple times throughout the school year. As we look over time, responses from The timing of the 2019-2020 survey was at the time schools changed to virtual learning. Preliminary data from the 2021-2022 survey for graduates show a higher percentage of completers who believe Very Well to Extremely Well they are prepared to impact P-12 student learning. After reviewing the data from previous surveys and the survey for the current year, data shows the pandemic may have had a negative impact on completer’s beliefs of their impact on student learning. Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 EMPLOYER SURVEY REPORT The survey was changed to provide specific program feedback from employers. However, this change created a longer time period to complete the survey. Of the 27 employers who started the survey, no one completed it. Looking at past trends, 96.82% of employers who responded to the 2019-2020 survey and 86% of employers who responded to the 2018-2019 survey stated completers were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to impact P-12 Student Learning. Employer Survey 2019-2020 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENT: TROY graduates are very well prepared coming out of college. 2020-2021 EMPLOYER FOCUS GROUP COMMENT: Both interviewed administrators strongly stated that I would like to hire more TROY graduates because they come to us well-prepared in knowledge and the course of study standards, and they look forward to working with P-12 students. One large school system that hires many of our graduates from all programs shared completed teacher evaluations from the administrators at 8 schools ranging from early childhood to high school. This large school system hires many of our graduates from all programs. These evaluations conducted by administrators utilized a proprietary protocol. This observation tool evaluates teacher behaviors that influence P-12 learning and administrator comments included student behaviors. Observations are scored 0-Ineffective, 1-Developing, 2-Effective, 3-Exemplary. With less than 10 individuals listed most programs (indicated by an *), the EPP categorized the programs into Early Childhood and Elementary and Secondary (Middle school to high school).

The Professional Knowledge indicator mean score was just below 2.0- effectiveness. Completers in the secondary group scored below effectiveness in Differentiation/Diversity. Although all programs are not represented in this data collection, scores indicate TROY completers have a positive influence on effective P-12 student learning. Comments from the administrators on strengths and weaknesses included: Early Childhood*, Elementary Collab K-6* Art*, Science*, Math*, History*, ELA* The summary of growth/focus will be used as suggestions to improve the programs at TROY. The Summary of Strengths will be included as strengths in the programs to maintain. Because the 2020-2021 Employer Survey resulted in no data, the EPP will use the data from the 2019-2020 Employer Survey. 2019-2020 EMPLOYER SURVEY 86.59% of the Troy University New Hires were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to use data driven decision making to access client /student progress. 96% of the Troy University New Hires were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to teach their Content Knowledge. 94.8% of the Troy University New Hires were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to demonstrate Professional Knowledge. 92% of the Troy University New Hires were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to demonstrate Professional Literacy.

Advanced (Graduate) Programs and Certification Programs are accredited through the following: Troy University ranks number 5 in 2020 Best Online Masters’ in Elementary Education by TheBestSchools.org. TheBestSchools selected the degree programs based on the quality of program and range of courses provided, as well as school awards, rankings, and reputation. The purpose of Troy’s Master of Education graduate program is to develop innovative, informed, reflective decision makers with outstanding pedagogical training. Troy University’s online MS in Education is a 36-credit program designed for practicing teachers in public or private school settings. Courses are 100 percent online – though some courses are also available on campus for students who prefer a hybrid program. Troy’s program also allows for flexible course planning, so that students are not confined to regimented course sequences and can take full- or part-time course loads. All teacher education certification programs are approved by the Alabama State Department of Education. The U.S. Department of Education reports that high-quality teacher preparation can make a dramatic impact on student outcomes – even outweighing negative factors like poverty. Because the 2020-2021 Employer Survey resulted in no data, the EPP will use the data from the 2019-2020 Employer Survey. 2019-2020 EMPLOYER SURVEY 100% of employers would hire more Troy University Completers.

As master teachers, instructional support personnel, and education specialists, they participate as leaders in their schools and contribute to their profession. Each candidate completes the state approved checklist for their particular program. Based on the recommendation to ALSDE, derived from the completion of the R & R/Review & Recommendation for Application Based on Completion of an Alabama Class A Program and Class AA Program and the Supplemental NA1/Recommendation for Certification forms. Two reasons have been uncovered as to why completers may not meet licensure requirements. One reason is that they have not submitted their licensure paperwork in a timely manner. Therefore, the submission shows up for the next academic year or years later. Another reason completers may not meet licensure requirements is that they have not been able to pass the Praxis exam in their field required by the Alabama State Department of Education. 2020-2021 FOLLOW-UP SURVEY FOR GRADUATES 90.63% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed full-time teaching. 3.13% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed outside of the teaching field. 100% of employers’ responding to the P-12 Employer Satisfaction Survey would continue to hire Troy graduates. Some teaching field positions have limited openings. Teachers will earn their certification in another field in order to be ready to apply and be hired when there is an opening. For example, the number of gifted specialists in a school system are low. General education teachers will earn gifted certification to be eligible to be hired when a position opens up or a new one is created.

Employees eligible for TROY's matching program will receive a match of 3% on a maximum of $18,000.00 of salary ($540.00 annual maximum [$45.00 monthly for a 12 month employee; $54.00 monthly for a 10 month employee]). An employee who earns $60,535.00 or more is considered ""highly compensated"" and does not qualify for TROY's match. Once an employee reaches highly compensated, and the Troy matching is discontinued, it will not be reinstated if the employee reverts back to a salary below the highly compensated level. Employees may still participate at the non-matching level. Troy University provides both 403b and 457b retirement savings plans. Each year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sets a limit on the amount of money you can voluntary contribute on a pretax basis to these optional retirement savings plans. These limits apply to all pretax contributions you make to any plan/plans at the University and any other employer you might have during the year.

Military Credit Use,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University recognizes the educational benefits of many experiences that occur outside the formal structure of accredited colleges and universities. Credit may be granted for military experience based on MOS (Army), AFSC (Air Force), or equivalent ratings by the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Our institution proudly grants credit for military learning and/or experience using the ACE Military Guide. Learn more about which credits we accept and how we apply them to your degree at Troy University. The University offers a range of undergraduate degree programs that require an 18-semester hour minor. The MILITARY OPERATIONS minor will satisfy degree requirements for any minor required for a Bachelor of Science program. The Military Operations Minor can be completed by applying a minimum of 18 semester hours of credit earned through military service as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE), Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), or military credit from other regionally accredited institutions of higher education. Servicemembers can often apply coursework and experience in Professional Military Training and Education to this minor. Service school courses will be evaluated according to the recommendations of the American Council on Education (ACE Guide) when official credentials have been presented by the student. Such recommendations, however, are not binding upon the University. The ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE IN GENERAL EDUCATION degree allows for the use of at least 34 semester hours of military credit. The 60sh ASGE degree program is comprised of 26 semester hours of GENERAL STUDIES and 34 semester hours of FREE ELECTIVE credit. While all of the degree programs at TROY offer scope for the transfer of military credit, the University offers a selection of bachelor's degree programs that are particularly accommodating to the military training and professional education undertaken by our men and women in uniform. These degree programs recognize the value of this professional training by allowing for the maximization of transferable credits and, subsequently, the shortening of the time to degree completion and graduation. The BACHELOR OF APPLIED SCIENCE degree program requires the completion of a 36 semester hour Resources and Technology Management major, of which 18sh must be ""Specialized Technical Credit."" One recognized source of such specialized credit is credit earned through military service as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) or Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). The 120sh BAS degree program is comprised of 45sh GENERAL STUDIES/36sh RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT MAJOR/18sh MINOR/21sh of FREE ELECTIVE credit. (If available, up to 57sh of military credit may be applied in this degree program towards the 18sh specialization, the 18sh military operations minor, and the 21sh of free electives.) TROY’s BACHELOR OF OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION builds off of military training, an Associate of Applied Science or other technical degrees in fields such as welding technology, airframe repair or fire science that meet TROY’s General Studies requirements. The program is designed to give students the training and preparation it takes to become an instructor at a community college, technical college or four-year institution. The program also equips students to pursue positions as Department of Defense Civilians. The BSOE degree program requires the completion of 30 semester hours of credentialed work-related experience which could include ACE recommended credit for professional military technical education or the Technical Education component of the CCAF degree. The 120sh BSOE degree program is comprised of 45sh GENERAL STUDIES/60sh OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM/15sh FREE ELECTIVE credit. (If available, up to 45sh of military credit may be applied in this degree program towards the 30sh of occupational specialization and 15sh of free electives.) The purpose of the proposed BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES (BIS) is to provide an expanded degree program, across multiple disciplines, for the Troy University student. The BIS will provide opportunities for TROY students to create three programs of focused disciplinary learning, based on existing University courses or through the application of appropriate ACE recommended credit which can be used to fulfill the requirements of the University’s Military Operation minor thereby satisfying one of the three programs of focus required for the BIS degree. Most undergraduate degree programs require some free elective credits, and some require as many as 20 semester hours of free elective credit. Therefore, unused ACE recommended credit is also commonly applied to the free elective requirement of all degree programs. Additionally, Troy University accepts a variety of CLEP exams, DSST (DANTES SUBJECT STANDARDIZED TEST) SCORES, and Advanced Placement (AP) exams as a means of achieving advanced standing in the University’s undergraduate programs.",https://www.troy.edu/military-veterans/troy-troops/credit-use.html

Workshops,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Download Agenda During each session you can choose to attend a different workshop to learn more about one of the following topics: Advanced Mapping, Modern Mapping, UAS/Mobile Mapping, UAS/ Mobile Mapping Demo/Tour, Geospatial Mapping, and Mapping Your Future, Surveying and mapping require highly sophisticated equipment which is constantly being upgraded. New technologies are emerging all the time to improve accuracy and speed of data collection. These technologies are changing the way surveying and mapping are done. Advancement in the hardware and software of drones, GPS, phone apps, 3D printing, laser scanning, Virtual reality, Augmenting Reality, Artificial Intelligence and other data collect tools will require geospatial professionals with the ability to adapt to all the change that is occurring in technology. Do you want to be involved with the latest technology and have a career that is constantly seeing new tools and more advanced processes? Come to the workshop to see what you could be a part of. Emphasis is on the technologies that help with the collection of data applicable to a licensed Land Surveyor. There is a desperate need for licensed Land Surveyors in the country, with high starting salaries. These land surveyors work with state of the art technologies that forms the basis for other professionals in the field of GIS (Geographic Information Systems). GIS is the technology that allows spatial and non-spatial data to be integrated, analyzed and presented. It has been a huge area of growth over the past 30 years. It is used for land and environmental management, social analysis, map making, navigation and visual analysis, together with inclusion of advanced techniques of web integration, massive data integration, and distributed computing. ​How do careers in this area get started? What skills do you need to get involved? Can you get a graduate degree in this field? Come to this workshop and find out the answers to these and other questions! Drones, also called UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and UASs (Unmanned Aerial Systems) are becoming more common in geospatial data collection. They are complemented by equivalent small boats (Z-boats) for hydrographic surveying. ​Drones can carry regular digital cameras, video cameras, multispectral cameras, laser scanners (LiDAR) and a range of other sensors. They allow data collection at low levels and higher resolutions, without the time and cost of hiring regular aircraft. Mobile scanning and mapping vehicles utilize laser scanners and imagery to collect information along roadways at highway speeds. This keeps surveyors out of busy roadways while minimizing disruptions to the traveling public. Scanning and mapping activities collect massive amounts of data that can be used to assess pavement conditions and collect information on assets outside of the paved roadway such as guardrails, signs, and utilities. This technology is possible through the combined use of a scanner, cameras, GPS positioning, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to bring all of the data into a 3-d environment for use in multiple applications. ​How can you make a career with drones and scanners, or just get involved with them? Come to this workshop and find out! ALDOT will have their collections of drones and other technology available and launch a drone for you to see in flight. Come and see the ALDOT's drone trailer and Mobile Mapping Truck!! ​How can you make a career with the latest data collecting technologies, or just get involved with them? Come to this workshop and find out! Dewberry with present geospatial technologies utilized within the industry and highlight mapping services available. Airborne lidar, airborne topobathymetric lidar, terrestrial lidar scanning, UAS, traditional survey, emergency response damage assessments and many more topics will be covered.

2018 - 2019,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Over the last two years, the School of HSTM has been actively promoting faculty-led study abroad opportunities for our students. In the spring semester alone, HSTM students and faculty traveled to China, Greece, Ireland, Scotland, and Switzerland to learn and experience new cultures. Dr. Dixon led a group of students to Ireland and Scotland over spring break to visit many historical and prominent tourism spots. The trip began in Dublin where they visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, Trinity College Book of Kells, and the Jameson Whiskey Distillery. Next, traveled to Belfast and visited filming locations for the popular television show, Game of Thrones. From Belfast, the group traveled on to Scotland where they visited the Edinburgh Castle which has loomed over the capital city for more than 1,000 years. Overall the trip was a success and the students thoroughly enjoyed their time spent in Ireland and Scotland. At the same time, Dr. Lewis and Dr. Xu led a group of students to Greece and Switzerland. Their trip began by arriving in Athens, Greece where students visited many historical landmarks with the Acropolis, Parthenon, and Temple of Athena being favorites of the group. Students also got to spend time shopping in the historical Plaka District and try many local delicacies along the way. After spending time in Athens, the group moved on to other regions of Greece that included Delphi, Tolo, and Ancient Olympia. Students got to see the historical location of the original Olympic games as well as the 2004 Olympic games. A highlight for many of the students was the Saronic Gulf Cruise that took the students to several smaller Grecian islands to explore local culture, artistry, and cuisine. On the way home, the group made a quick stop in Switzerland before continuing their travels back to the states. Dr. Price-Howard also helped in leading a study abroad trip to China over spring break that was hosted by the Troy University Confucius Institute. There were two HSTM students who took advantage of this fantastic opportunity to visit different cities in China and learn about the language, culture, history, and Chinese cuisines. While in China, the group had the opportunity to climb the Great Wall of China, visit a panda habitat, ride the Bullet Train, and take part in a traditional Chinese tea ceremony. Dr. Dixon is currently offering a faculty-led study abroad opportunity to Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. This trip will take place December 10-18, 2019. Some of the trip highlights include touring the BMW headquarters in Munich, Dashuau Concentration Camp & Memorial tour, and visits to the Nymphenburg Palace and St. Stephen's Cathedral. For more information on this trip, please visit TROY Abroad or email Dr. Dixon at awdixon@troy.edu. Cameron Christopher is a senior majoring in Sports Management with a minor in Global Business from Anniston, AL. During the summer months, Cameron had the opportunity to work on the BMW Ultimate Driving Experience Tour. What has this experience provided to you? The BMW Tour was an amazing experience - I had the chance to drive $100,000+ BMW's around and work alongside professional race car drivers on the racecourse. I also had the opportunity to go to California this summer for the first time while touring with BMW. Working in Miami, Florida and San Francisco, California has opened my mind to wanting a career that allows me to travel. What advice would you give to fellow HSTM students? The last thing I would like to tell everyone would be to never give up on a company you are passionate about because I received this job offer a year after I applied and I never expected to hear back. Cameron has been invited back to California by his superiors to work in Los Angeles next month on the BMW Tour. He enjoyed his experiences with the BMW Tour and told us, ""whether you're looking to learn, try out the latest innovations in driving, or just have a good time, the BMW Ultimate Driving Experience is the place to go.” Now that Cameron has returned to campus to finish out his senior year, he will be working in Campus Manager role doing marketing work for Amazon prime. The faculty and staff within the School of HSTM are very proud of Cameron and his accomplishments during his time here at Troy University. Morgan Long is a senior Sport Management major with a minor in Leadership Development. He has been able to serve Troy as a member of Freshman Forum, an IMPACT Leader, SGA Senator, Trojan Ambassador, and Vice President of Campus Activities. He was recently elected as the 2019-2020 SGA President and also serves as the Ambassador Association President. This foundation has given Morgan opportunities to learn and develop as a professional in and out of the classroom. While a student in the HSTM program, Morgan has had the opportunity to work for the Birmingham Barons for the past two summers as a Stadium Operations Intern and he currently works there as a Group Sales Intern. How has your education and coursework in the HSTM program helped prepare you for your future career path? It is amazing the amount of times I have been tasked with project at work that directly correlates with the material I have learned in class. Through these experiences it is evident that the course work we go over in our classes gives us an obvious advantage once we enter our respective professions. What advice would you give to other Troy and HSTM students? If I tell any student one thing it is to get involved; there are tons of opportunities and organizations on and off campus for students to not just experience and join but to thrive in. Take this time in your life to find out what you are passionate about and then go for it! You will be provided every opportunity as an HSTM student to get involved in Sports, Hospitality, and Tourism, but it is up to you to take advantage of these opportunities! Enjoy this time in college and don't be afraid to ask questions to fellow students and faculty. GO TROJANS! Congratulations, Morgan; we are excited to see what you will accomplish to better Troy University during the 2019-2020 academic year! “ I am appreciative to be a member of the Trojan Family while being a student in the School of HSTM. The professors in HSTM truly care about the well-being of every student and are united in the goal of getting job placements for their students upon graduation.” The HSTM Fun Fest held at the Troy SportsPlex was also another successful event put on by the HSTM students under the supervision of Dr. Christina Martin. The children of the community were given the opportunity to come out and have a good time by playing different games and engaging in activities such as relay races, bouncy houses, “home run derby”, and softball pitching simulations amongst other fun activities. The undergraduate Event Management class was responsible for the overall planning, seeking out sponsors to assist with the funding of the event, and promoting the event to the community. There was a great turnout and all those involved, whether volunteering or participating, appeared to have a great time. Each semester, the HSTM Summit is held to allow our senior students the opportunity to present their business plan projects to a panel of faculty members. In the spring semester, there were eight team presentations and one solo presentation given. The students work diligently throughout the semester with faculty consultants to develop a business plan with components focusing on facilities, finances, and marketing. To conclude their presentation, they give an overall sales pitch asking the ""investors"" for support of their business based on the information they have presented. The floor is then opened for an intensive question and answer session to make sure the teams are well prepared and understand their business plan fully. Students came up with some great business ideas; we saw presentations ranging from The Yard, a food truck park eatery with a bar concept, to a team wanting to advance a Division II university to Division I. The ideas are limitless and it is always fun to see what the teams come up with each semester. This is always a great event for the School of HSTM as all students are expected to attend, learn, and participate. Many of the students find watching the presentations to be of value to them for when it comes their turn to complete in the HSTM 4499-Seminar course. Once students successfully complete this major project, many feel a huge sense of relief as they realize graduation is waiting for them just around the corner. Thank you to our Event Management course students for organizing and hosting this elaborate event for us. The HSTM Banquet was held the evening of April 17th after the events of the HSTM Summit had concluded. This event also served as another opportunity for the students in the Event Management class to plan and host an event from start to finish. Every year, a theme is chosen for the celebration and this year's selected theme was ""Back to the Future"" Students and faculty members were encouraged to dress in clothing from their favorite decade. This was a fun, celebratory event for our students to be praised for all of their hard work and accomplishments over the past academic year. Dr. Dixon shared a few words with everyone, awards were given out to students and delicious food was catered by Sips on the Square.

Allen E. Jones,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: ajones@troy.edu B.S., Francis Marion College, 1987 M.A., University of South Carolina, 1992 Ph.D., University of South Carolina, 1998 Antiquity, Late Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance Late Antiquity, in particular Gaul and Gregory of Tours In August 2020 Jones published Death and Afterlife in the Pages of Gregory of Tours: Religion and Society in Late Antique Gaul (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2020). Bishop Gregory of Tours was a prolific writer of hagiography and author of a ten-book history popularly called the History of the Franks. Jones argues that elements of Gallic society informed Gregory’s decisions to compose in the genres he did. Parents and other relations instilled in the youth a belief that it was imperative to trust the saints in order to overcome the ills of the age. It was the prospect of dying that convinced young Gregory to enter the clergy. The happenstance of warfare raging about the diocese during the early years of Bishop Gregory’s episcopacy compelled the budding hagiographer to also write history. Death figures prominently in both kinds of writings. Jones contends that the miracula and historia reveal how the author mused about signs pertaining to individuals’ deaths and speculated about the eternal fates, both heavenly and infernal, for many characters in his text. Not least among those whose afterlife prospects Gregory investigated and sometimes proclaimed were members of the royal Merovingian family in whose courts the bishop circulated. Around the twentieth year of Gregory’s episcopacy, death deprived the writer from putting the corpus into final form. In 2009 Jones published Social Mobility in Late Antique Gaul: Strategies and Opportunities for the Non-Elite (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press; reprinted in paperback, 2014). The work investigates the extent to which people who were not part of the power structures of Gaul impacted society as they pursued their own goals. It details how particular groupings of non-aristocrats--from lesser clerics and beggars registered at local churches to physicians and folk healers--cooperated and contended with others, adopting strategies not unlike those of society's elites to improve their lot in life. Jones is left to wonder how publication of Death and Afterlife coincided with the pandemic of 2020 and publication of Social Mobility corresponded with the 2008/9 economic meltdown. He hesitates to embark on another manuscript.

Begin Sorority Recruitment Registration These dates are subject to change. We will update those who have signed up for recruitment if any changes are made. A sorority letter of recommendation is a practice used by some of our sororities to provide an opportunity for potential new members to be introduced to a sorority. It highlights your accomplishments and experiences that show you will be an engaged member of a sorority and uphold the values and expectations of membership. Sometimes women and their caregivers go to great lengths to procure letters of recommendation under the false assumption recommendations are mandatory for participation in recruitment. Sorority letters of recommendation are not required for participation in the recruitment process. There is a great deal of false information about recommendations that is perpetuated by rumors. Do not listen to rumors. If you are asking an alumnae to write a recommendation, the BEST PRACTICE is for her to log in to her sorority national website to obtain a recommendation form. You can send alumnae the links provided below where alumnae may log in. If an alumnae does not feel comfortable logging in to a site, they can contact the sororities at the emails below. There is not a specific due date for recommendations, but it is helpful to have them in by Friday, July 28, 2023.

The Panhellenic Council's membership recruitment eligibility policy is a minimum requirement. Each sorority sets its academic standards for joining. The sorority women will carefully evaluate each individual's grades and high school activities going through recruitment when making membership decisions. High school graduates must have a 2.2 overall GPA (on a 4.0 scale) & be accepted to Troy University. We will use the grades that you submitted when you were accepted to Troy University. You may do so if you wish to notify us of grade changes from the time you were accepted. Upper-level students at Troy must have a 2.2 GPA average. Transfer students must have a 2.2 overall average based on 12 hours; if a transfer student has fewer than 12 hours, her eligibility will be based on her high school grade point average. The Potential Member's Bill of Rights was adopted unanimously at the 1989 NPC Biennial Conference. We know that parents and their daughters have serious discussions about whether they can afford a sorority. Just as you need to be informed regarding the cost associated with a college education, you need to understand the financial obligation associated with sorority membership. Each woman joining a sorority should be aware of the dues, fees and other expenses that are involved and should consider these when making financial plans to attend college. During formal recruitment, a potential member should ask sorority members about financial obligations and payment options. Each sorority sets its own fees and payment schedules. As with other organizations, there are financial obligations to be met when you join a sorority. Some responsibilities are: Please be aware that the cost of living in a sorority house is the same as living in the residence halls. It may cost a little more the first year, but it will be your sorority for the rest of your years at TROY. It will become a circle of friends, a group to belong to for the rest of your life.

If you choose a more expensive pin/badge, then the cost will be higher.Semester Dues Average: $700.00, around $140.00 per monthSemester Dues Range: $520.00 to $697.00You may be wondering about the dues range. Some sororities will include the cost of everything (minus optional t-shirts) in their dues and will not charge anything extra. Some sororities do not include the cost of everything in their fees and will charge you for an event, such as a formal you select to go to. Recruitment week is a busy and fun-filled week. We have found that those of you who are going through recruitment in the fall need someone to help you throughout the week. Panhellenic has selected sorority women to take on this particular role. These women are Pi Chis and have been carefully selected to assist you and answer all your questions. They have been specially trained for this particular role. The counselors are well-versed in university and Panhellenic procedures and policies. They can give information and advice on almost any aspect of sorority and campus life. For that week, they will not associate with their sorority; they will be there just for you. Helping you during the busy yet fun-filled days, explaining membership recruitment rules, suggesting what to wear for events, and assisting with any problems during the week are among the duties of a Pi Chi. Most importantly, the Pi Chi will lead weekly small group meetings to explain the next day's activities carefully. During these meetings, discuss any questions or problems with your Pi Chi. She will be a true friend to you. The University Meal ticket program begins on Saturday, August 10, 2024.

Global Scholars Program,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Focused on developing the international awareness and global preparedness of students, the Global Scholar Initiative will complement the existing University Honors and Study Abroad programs with a globally focused, major-specific track developed within, and by, each of the University’s five academic colleges. The goal of the program is to enhance global awareness of students interested in completing the University’s Global Scholar Initiative. The initiative will train select cohorts of students to become more globally aware, and therefore more globally prepared to pursue careers or graduate opportunities in an international environment. One of the most important aspects of the Global Scholar Initiative, which also serves as the point of commonality across each of the University’s five academic colleges, involves adding to Study Abroad opportunities a focused research (or discipline-specific professional project) component conducted in an international setting under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Although many study abroad opportunities are currently available for TROY students across all academic colleges, one goal of the Global Scholar Initiative is to transform those opportunities by grounding them into more meaningful international research opportunities. TROY aims to enhance students’ capacity to engage in scholarly research and intends to do so by creating situations that permit them to work under the guidance of qualified faculty members, and conduct research in an international and intercultural context. This will help students obtain a higher-level academic understanding of their discipline, thereby developing their employment potential with an international experience that is grounded in systematic scholarly endeavors.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/global-scholars/index.html

Patti Baum,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: What a day we all have had. The quote that keeps going through my head is one by George Santayana: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. It makes me wish more and more people could do what we did today. A lot of important history right here in this town. And yet there’s still so much work to do for civil rights. I’m Patti Baum, and I was Charles’ wife. I just want to take a few minutes to talk about why we are here; what inspired this gift. In January 2016, a few months after Charles died; I went with one of my daughters and her husband to see Hamilton on Broadway. Hamilton, the musical, celebrates history and honors a great man’s legacy, a man many of us didn’t really know a lot about before the book and the show. After Hamilton’s death, there’s a poignant line that says …”who lives, who dies, who tells your story”. His wife Eliza asks what Hamilton might have done if he hadn’t run out of time. Eliza vowed to preserve her husband’s legacy, and one of the things she was most proud of was that she founded an orphanage in Hamilton’s name, an orphanage which still thrives today in New York City. I walked out of the show weeping, and said to my daughter, “I have to find my orphanage.” Quite simply, I wanted to find a meaningful place to tell Charles’ story. I asked myself, “What would Charles have done if he he’d had more time?” And then I remembered an email he wrote to his friend Jim. Jim had just seen the movie, Selma, and he asked Charles what it was like to grow up in Montgomery in the 50’s. It was Charles’ answer to the question in an email that inspired me to make this gift. For those of you who have heard this, I apologize. But I think it’s worth hearing again. The movie which captures me and my family is not Selma but Driving Miss Daisy. However, your questions are very timely as I have been thinking about those times and my family's reactions to the civil rights movement a lot recently---so, here goes perhaps more than you want: Background: In the mid 1950's and 1960's, my father was a prominent Montgomery businessman and civic leader--President of almost everything--the Kiwanis Club, Chamber of Commerce, United Appeal, etc.--and honored as Man of the Year by the YMCA--all pretty big deals in a small-ish southern town, especially for a Jew. My grandfather, and I kid you not, was known by everyone as ""Colonel"", an honorary, non-military title awarded him by an Alabama Governor in the 1940's, I suppose. My father was active in politics himself--never as a candidate but as an advisor/fund-raiser. They both were--and I grew up as-- FDR/New Deal Democrats. Both my grandfather and father were also each Directors of one of the two large local banks--the 'Jewish seat' of those banks' boards I guess. Throughout school (large, public, segregated), my sister and I were also sort of big fish in a small pond--sports, class offices, etc. Johnny, my brother, too, I'm sure, but he was nine or so when I went to college. So what our family had, on the one hand, were comfort, security, and a certain prominence plus the attainment of much-prized assimilation. But, on the other hand, there must have been a feeling that all of this was perhaps built on less-than-firm ground. We were assimilated but still Jewish and members of a very small minority. The times were politically strained of course. There was McCarthyism before the high tide of civil rights. I remember distinctly a local politician who was a perennial seeker of many state/local offices in the mid-late 50's--and he was a true anti-Semitic fringe candidate who always ran on a platform against the ""Communist-Jewish Conspiracy"" and would go on TV and rant and rave and invariably mention my father by name as a supporter of his opponent. And so the desire to protect our vested interests came at a cost--very important in hindsight: we were taught not to rock the boat lest we put our 'position' at risk. The long-time Rabbi in Montgomery was very much like this as well---prominent in the community but a protector of the status quo. Like most (not all) southern Rabbis, he preached tolerance for others and support of the oppressed--but of a timid sort--not speaking out, not joining marches. He (and we) were not so keen on promoting true change as we did not want our privileges to change. Privately and at home, my parents were ""liberal"" on racial matters in the sense we were taught to be respectful of Negroes (never would the N word have been tolerated) and to support black and white charities, schools, etc.. We had a black cook, maid, baby sitter, gardener etc. and 'treated them nicely' with genuine concern and affection--picture the (few) proper white people portrayed in The Help. So, the bottom line: I grew up as a democrat, liberal (certainly relative to the time and place) and felt 'sympathetic, kindly' to the black people (all in a lesser station, no social friends) in our lives. What we were not were brave. Nor courageous. Nor willing to risk our own comfort for a greater cause. During the 1955-56 bus boycott (I was in my early teens), we would drive our help to and from their homes--sort of subverting the intent of both sides--protecting the people who worked for us and our own comfort. At Princeton (Freedom Rider time) and Harvard (Selma) I would object to broad critical generalizations against the south, point out northern hypocrisy but was certainly 'for' the goal of civil rights. I was actually at the March on Washington and heard King's 'I Have a Dream' speech and remember being totally inspired by it--but, typically, I was not there as a marcher but rather as a spectator--I was working as a summer intern for the Commerce Dept. right on the mall. That year (1963), as one of three Jews in Cottage Club (an Eating Club proud of its 'southern' tradition), I was in favor of but not outspoken for the selection of its first black member. (He was denied admission). So, finally, to answer your questions, I did not find the time particularly ""hard"". I was not engaged in the struggle actively at all, though my sympathies were with the movement. I feel worse about my behavior looking back than I think I honestly did at the time. I know I was not at all brave but kind of gave myself a quasi -pass because 'my heart was in the right place’.... HOWEVER, the words that still make me cringe and feel shame are these by Martin Luther King: ""History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."" Guilty, Dr. King, as charged. Love...Charles So you see, I wanted to be sure that Charles’ story was told, and remembered. I want his children and grandchildren to know what his life was like growing up in Alabama during a period of great unrest. I want them to know why he encouraged all of us to speak out and stand up for what is right. I want them to know who he was, about how much he loved all of us, about his quick wit, his brilliance, his love of education and especially history, and his commitment to just causes - I wanted to do something that Charles might have done had he not run out of time. And I also wanted to honor his Alabama roots. So I asked Charles’ brother, John, to come with me to Montgomery to visit this museum. All we had to do was meet Dr. Felicia Bell to know we were in the right place. Dr. Bell outlined her vision, her plans for summer camps for under- served children of Alabama, and her hopes to spread Rosa Parks’ message, but in a new more contemporary way – to promote self-esteem and empowerment, and to teach young children about bullying. I’m not sure any of us sitting there that day envisioned this weekend! One might not immediately think so, but Charles and Rosa Parks actually had a lot in common. Now please know that I’m not comparing the significance of their places in history, and of course they both had very different life experiences in Montgomery. And so you might ask, what would a white Jewish man who lived most of his life in Baltimore have in common with a Southern woman of color? Well… they both had profound humility, a strong sense of decency, a truly good soul, and the determination to fight for their beliefs. They both had Southern grace. They both valued education and had open minds; neither carried any hate in their hearts. They were authentic, gentle and kind, and fiercely loyal to their friends. They both deeply loved family. It is a tribute to both of them that all of you are here. I thank you for being here. Charles was so proud of his son Matthew. Matt is now head of the history department at Gilman School, one of the finest schools in Baltimore. Matt also taught for two years at Montgomery Academy after he graduated from Brown. Matt is husband of Deb, and more importantly, father of Beatrice and Max. And loving brother to Katie, Staci, and Beth. It’s only right that Matt introduces David Shapiro, his lifelong friend and our keynote speaker.",https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/about/charles-cahn-baum-family-atrium/patti-baum.html

Philosophy,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The University seeks to provide an appropriate academic, cultural, and social environment for the student. In accordance with the mission of the University, the School of Nursing serves a diverse student body linked through an environment supported by traditional, nontraditional, and emerging electronic formats. Global access to University resources facilitates educational mobility for students who may be geographically bound. The School’s faculty serves the students, the community, and the University through teaching, service, scholarship, research, and other creative activities. The School of Nursing faculty believes that humanity consists of unique holistic beings with intrinsic worth and dignity who have the right to self-determination, well-being, and equity. As part of various groups, individuals interact according to individualistic and group needs in the community. These interacting individuals and groups, with their cultural and social beliefs and values, create the society within the larger environment. The faculty believes that the environment, an aggregate of all internal and external dimensions, not only influences individuals and groups but is also influenced by them. The environment provides the context for the development of individuals’ social identities, the identification of health needs, and the evolution of nursing. Through ongoing, interactive processes, the environment and nursing influence each other. The nursing profession, therefore, advocates for and serves the health needs and interests of a global society and collaborates with other disciplines toward this goal. The faculty believes that health, a dynamic state, is an observable manifestation of individual and group adaptive responses to the environment. Health is the focus of the discipline of nursing and includes physical, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual components. Since the state of health is culturally defined diverse or individually-defined, health-seeking behaviors reflect culturally diverse perceptions and values. Individuals have the right to make decisions about their health. The ability to make informed decisions is influenced by knowledge, perceptions, and values. As an art and a science, nursing practice utilizes cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills in meeting the health needs of diverse individuals and social groups of all ages. Nursing practice applies nursing theory and research as well as knowledge from other sciences and the humanities. Nursing practice is the application of evidence-based clinical decisions in a caring environment for the improvement and achievement of optimal states of health for individuals and groups. Clinical decisions lead to therapeutic nursing interventions, which are based on assessment, diagnosis and evaluation of human responses to internal and external environmental dimensions that affect actual or potential health states. Key elements used in professional nursing practice within a multidisciplinary healthcare system are caring, evidence-based clinical decisions, communication, collaboration, cultural humility, social awareness, patient safety, ethical competence, information, research, and patient care technologies. Nursing practice includes the right and responsibility for continuous evaluation of personal and professional behaviors and values in addition to development and maintenance of legal and ethical standards for professional excellence. Nursing practice requires reflection, lifelong learning and application of sound evidence and research for quality improvement. Nursing participates in social processes to positively influence healthcare policy and outcomes. The faculty believes that education is a process shared by the teacher and the learner and is the exploration, utilization and generation of knowledge through a spirit of inquiry and self-motivation. The learner and the teacher share the right and responsibility to achieve educational goals through participation in the educative process. An organized setting with planned learning activities, utilizing traditional, nontraditional and emerging electronic formats, provides opportunities to achieve these educational goals. The approach to teaching and learning varies with individual needs, abilities, and experiences. Teachers and learners are responsible for creating, promoting, and maintaining standards of academic and professional excellence through individual lifelong learning. The faculty believes that nursing education is the means by which students are prepared for competent nursing practice at multiple levels. These levels of nursing practice are facilitated through various educational opportunities that are best provided in a collegiate setting. Associate degree in nursing is preparation for practice as a registered nurse and serves as the foundation for further nursing education. The practice of the associate degree nurse includes functioning as a provider and manager of care, a patient advocate, an educator for patients and their support system, a consumer of best evidence, and a member within the discipline of nursing. The associate degree graduate is prepared to provide holistic care to patients to include cultural and social beliefs and values across the lifespan, and may practice in primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings. Baccalaureate degree in nursing is preparation for professional nursing practice and graduate study. The practice of the baccalaureate degree nurse includes functioning as a designer, manager and coordinator of care, member of the profession, provider of direct and indirect care, and evaluator and consumer of research and best evidence. The BSN graduate reflects accountable, evidence-based clinical decision-making in environments where outcomes of health states may or may not be predictable to ensure safe, quality patient-centered care. The baccalaureate degree graduate is a generalist who provides comprehensive nursing care for all ages of individuals, families, communities, and diverse populations in a variety of social, dynamic and complex healthcare settings. Master’s degree in nursing is preparation for the beginning level of advanced nursing practice and doctoral study. Advanced nursing practice encompasses the roles of expert clinician, educator, administrator, consultant, and translator of research and evidence-based practice.

It is anticipated that this approval process would include college and/or departmental committee(s) or some similar structure and that the final decision for this process will reside with each college Dean. Final approval of all textbooks used by a college will reside with the Dean of that college or his/her designee. Textbooks will be recommended by full time faculty for courses that they teach exclusively and these recommendations will be approved through the process established by the Dean. Textbooks for courses taught by multiple faculty will be recommended by the faculty teaching these courses and will be approved through the process established by the Dean. Approved textbook orders will be initiated at the appropriate unit level (college or department) as established by the Dean of each college. These orders will be submitted in a timely fashion to the appropriate campus bookstore to ensure availability for student purchase and use. Textbooks will be chosen that contribute to the overall learning experiences and outcomes of the students. The guiding principle in textbook selection is a commitment to the quality and affordability of textbooks and student learning materials used in courses. Whenever possible and appropriate, selected textbooks should be reasonably priced, have a reasonable shelf-life for continued student use beyond a single semester/term and provide students with maximized cost savings and buy-back opportunities. Approved changes of textbooks will be communicated in a timely manner to the appropriate campus bookstore personnel to ensure availability for the designated course(s). All textbook changes or revisions will be made following the process established by the Dean of each college and with the final approval of the Dean or her/his designee.

Policy and Procedures,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University IRB Policy and Procedures AOP 2-29-12-01 (Revised 5/7/2013) RESEARCH MISCONDUCT POLICY AND PROCEDURES 1. Introduction 1.1 General Policy Research is an integral part of Troy University's mission. All TROY faculty, staff and students must maintain high professional and ethical standards in all research activities. It is also the responsibility of all TROY faculty, staff and students to report reasonable suspicions of research misconduct. Every allegation of research misconduct will be investigated through the procedures set forth in this document. 1.2 Scope This policy is based on the Public Health Service (PHS) Policies on Research Misconduct (42 C.F.R 93) as well as guidelines from professional associations such as the American Psychological Association. This policy applies to all TROY faculty, staff, or students who are directly affiliated with TROY during the period in which research is conducted. ""Faculty"" is defined as any individual, whether full-time or adjunct, teaching at least one class for TROY during the research period. A person is considered a TROY student if they are enrolled in at least one class during the study period. 1.3 Definitions 1.4 Statute of Limitations Only research conducted within six years of the allegation of research misconduct will be investigated, unless one or more of the following conditions is present: 1.5 Confidentiality of Respondents, Complainants and Research Subjects The confidentiality of the respondents’ and complainants’ identities will be protected to the maximum extent possible.

She decided on this major because of her love for people and her passion to help others achieve their goals. She chose an Event Management minor the first year it was integrated into the program at TROY and has since loved it every step of the way. One of the reasons she chose Event Management to minor in is because she has always had great organization and time management skills, which are essential for success in event management. Torey is a member of the HSTM Honors Society and says her favorite part of the program here at TROY is the way the professors truly care about their student’s accomplishments and take the time to teach them life skills that will be utilized in their future careers. This program provides students with a plethora of hands-on learning experiences and opportunities so that when it is time to be in the real world, the students feel equipped with the skills they will need to be successful. So far, she has completed one summer internship with HarborWalk Village in Destin, Florida. During this internship she focused on marketing and events, and she is now currently in the process of completing her second internship working in Event Coordinating at B Graves in Troy. Torey believes that the best part about the Hospitality industry is that it is always growing, and the opportunities seem endless. After graduation she plans on pursuing her love for special events and hopes to find a career in wedding planning. “I currently work with Kaiser Realty by Wyndham Vacation Rentals in Gulf Shores, Alabama. While obtaining my degree from TROY, I accepted an internship with Resort Quest in Destin, Florida. Over the course of 12 weeks my primary task was working at the front desk as a guest service agent, and in housekeeping as a quality assurance inspector. It was important that we worked and trained in both the front and back of the house to realize the importance of each department and how interdependent they are to one another. Having previous experience working in hotels provided a great foundation in preparing me to be successful during my internship; however, moving into the vacation rental spectrum added new information to my repertoire.” Throughout the internship, our mentors and managers went above and beyond to help us grow in our respective fields while also providing us with ample opportunities to network with the company. By maximizing those opportunities, I was offered a full-time position with the company as a Homeowner Liaison. The primary role as a liaison is to correspond with the owners regarding their property status and availability and also coordinating with vendors while also ensuring the property is up to Kaiser standards. “As Wyndham has started the process in becoming two publicly traded companies, Wyndham Hotel Group (Parsippany, NJ) and Wyndham Vacation Ownership (Orlando, FL), my goal is to continue down the management track as an area manager next, then become an executive general manager and ultimately transfer to the corporate headquarters in Orlando. I can definitely say that the faculty at TROY played an instrumental role in my career success. While the classes were hard at times, the information and experience that I gained has been key in achieving what I’ve done so far and pursing my future endeavors.” What are some of your duties as the Account Coordinator for AIM Marketing Solutions? “I work under our SunTrust account and manage all of the ticket assets that SunTrust has throughout the Southeast and up the East Coast as these tickets are used by bankers for client entertainment. I am in charge of distribution of these tickets as well as reporting attendee information. I also work on the sponsorship side within reporting sponsorship requests that SunTrust receives so they can be evaluated. I really like learning more about sponsorships on the corporate side because I have been on the other side asking for a sponsorship and now I see how they get evaluated, why they are approved or denied and the whole process of renewals.” How did your experience at TROY help you find your position after graduation? “My experience at TROY required me to become comfortable in what I considered uncomfortable situations. The practice of the interview process that I got from taking the Senior Seminar class helped me tremendously because I felt more comfortable and confident when interviewing for this job. Funny story, I initially learned about AIM as a company back in October when I was doing my Senior Seminar professional portfolio binder. Then in March I was looking around at Atlanta sports marketing agencies and AIM’s website came up and I went on their website again and they had a posting for this full-time position.” What has been your most memorable experience since graduating from TROY? My most memorable experience has definitely been getting this job at AIM. I moved to Atlanta right after graduation with a job at The Aspire Group as a Sales Associate, and shortly after starting I realized that job was just not for me and I starting looking for other options. Long story short…if I had not taken the sales associate job then I probably would not have found my current job here at AIM. What are some of your duties as the Recruiting Coordinator of Football? “Organizing and executing a 12-month recruiting plan for on and off campus.” How did your experience at TROY help you find your first position after graduation? “I worked in the athletics department as a graduate assistant, and the networking and connections I made were huge for me. I was able to get linked up with people that not only were willing to help me pursue my goals but were very instrumental in obtaining some of them so far.” What has been your most memorable experience since graduating from TROY? “I would have to say being in the building every day at Alabama last football season as the team won the National Championship. It was incredible to see how much work and effort went into obtaining that goal. To see the ups and downs of a season, and how well the players and coaches maintained the same level of consistency each and every day was amazing.” If you could give HSTM students once piece of advice, what would it be? “Follow your heart in what you want to do with your life. Work your butt off to get where you want to go, and don’t let bumps in the road get you off your plan!” What qualities do you look for when searching for a new hire? “Hiring someone is tough. Everyone looks or seems great during an interview (most of the time), but I go off of connections and people that I trust. I want to feel like I know the person I am hiring and listening to the ones you do know helps. I want someone that works hard. If you will work hard, the rest will come.” What are some of your duties as the Assistant Director of Communications? “As the event manager for HarborWalk Village, I work directly underneath the event director and as a team we are in charge of executing large scale events on the harbor throughout the year. The size of the events range from 600 to 6,000 and include events like themed pub crawls, weekly parades, and our ever-so-popular Tequila & Taco Festival. My position also includes a lot of marketing duties as well. We are in charge of marketing out events both physically and electronically...It keeps me busy!” How did your experience at TROY help you find your first position after graduation? “I started out as an intern here at HarborWalk Village the summer before I graduated. The way I discovered the position was through another TROY alum. Abby recruited us as interns, and right before I graduated I was contacted and offered a full time position. TROY helped me make connections I thought I never could. The HSTM program specifically helped me with my resume and interview skills, which I will carry with me in every position I have in life.” If you could give HSTM students one piece of advice, what would it be? “Making connections is the most important thing in any “people” related business. Make sure you are memorable when meeting people in the industry you want to thrive in! Never lose sight of your goals, smile big, and most importantly get on Dr. Dixon’s good side.

Brookings, SD Kaitlyn Russ: Troy Athletic Ticket Office Troy, AL The School of HSTM hosted the 10th Annual HSTM Charity Golf Tournament at the Troy Country Club on March 26th. There was a record number of participants as there were 17 teams of 4 players and one additional team of 3 members, as reported by HSTM student Trent Patterson. As a requirement for the Event Management course, all students were required to assist with the planning and execution of this event. Patterson served on the Event Operation Committee for the class offered on campus and explained, “We helped Dr. [Christina] Martin organize the schedule of tournament, recruit sponsors and teams to participate, scheduled food delivery and service.” Janard Estell, another HSTM student, stated that he was impressed with the overall turnout of the event and actually exceeded his expectations. He went on to say, as long as he is in the area that he would definitely participate in anyway necessary to again ensure the success of this event. The funds allocated from the tournament were donated to the Boys and Girls Club of Troy. Last year, $2,500 was donated but with numbers increasing during this years’ tournament, we could expect an even larger donation! The tournament is looking to grow its participation even more, as they are using it to benefit the young children of the community, while enjoying the comradery of friends and colleagues. Be on the lookout for this event next year. The HSTM Fun Fest held at the Troy SportsPlex was also another successful event put on by the HSTM students under the supervision of Dr. Christina Martin. The children of the community were given the opportunity to come out and have a good time by playing different games and engaging in activities such as relay races, bouncy houses, “home run derby”, and softball pitching simulations amongst other fun activities. The undergraduate Event Management class was responsible for the overall planning, seeking out sponsors to assist with the funding of the event, and promoting the event to the community. There was a great turnout and all those involved, whether volunteering or participating, appeared to have a great time. The HSTM Summit provided senior students the opportunity to present their projects that they worked tirelessly on throughout the semester. Students spent many hours in the HSTM offices meeting with their professors to perfect the information they were researching, analyzing, and forming to present a sales pitch to a panel of investors (HSTM professors). Objectively, relief felt by the students was always evident following the completion of their presentations. Callie Wallace, who assisted with the coordinating of the Summit stated that they enjoyed witnessing the relief shown by their fellow scholars. They, too, are seniors who presented at the Summit, so they also felt the pressure applied by the HSTM professors during the Q&A panel session. The 2018 HSTM Conference was one to remember, as many great speakers gave the students their monies worth. It was a time well spent with presenters from different companies and organizations around the Southeast. The conference was coordinated by the Graduate Event Management course, under the supervision of Dr. Fred Green. In addition to the speeches given, an internship fair was available for students to take the opportunity to network with some of the familiar faces from the podium. Titus Thomas, who is currently pursuing his Master’s degree in Sport Management, gave some insight into his role. “I acted as the Technology and Event Logistics Committee Chair. Essentially, my responsibilities were to obtain guest speakers and the technology needed to effectively relay the information produced by the speakers. Dalton Fuller and Carl Tang also assisted with these efforts. We were in charge of designing the HSTM Conference Program booklets and the Conference plaque, as well.” The Conference started out with a bang by having the Troy Trojans head football coach, Neal Brown, speak to the attendees. Troy Athletics Director, Jeremy McClain, and the Sun Belt Commissioner, Karl Benson, also graced the Conference with their presence and thoughts on hard work, dedication, and touched on the importance of networking in the sport industry. All in all, the event was a great opportunity for students to gain knowledge and interact with professionals who are acclimated to the industries of hospitality, sports and tourism. The HSTM Banquet capped off the ending of a great semester for both students and staff. The students were able to gain hands on experience throughout the semester with preparing and hosting different events. The banquet was held to acknowledge and honor the hard work put forth this semester by the HSTM students. Dr. Dixon shared a few words with everyone, awards were given out to both students and staff and delicious food was catered by Hooks BBQ. Immediately following the banquet, everyone enjoyed a tailgate at the TROY Baseball game on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Some participated in an intriguing game of wiffleball, and yes, that is Dr. Dixon to your left preparing to swing the bat. All in all, this was a great event and those involved evidently enjoyed themselves.

We’ll make the transition as seamless as possible so you can keep your focus on the important stuff. Transfer credit refers to the number of transferable credit(s) or course equivalent(s) earned at another regionally accredited institution that is accepted towards a degree program at Troy University. The Academic Evaluation Center processes all transfer credit for Troy University. Once a student has submitted an undergraduate application and 'OFFICIAL' transcripts of previous work attempted have been received, student services personnel will then send a request to the Academic Evaluation Center (AEC) to have those official transcripts evaluated. After the evaluation request is received by the AEC, each completed course will be reviewed for potential transfer credit. If credits are older and course descriptions are not available online, free elective credit will be granted until the student provides additional course information if applicable. Troy University processes a high volume of official transcripts from institutions worldwide. Currently, credit evaluation requires five to ten days from the time of receipt by the Academic Evaluation Center, so please be patient with our staff.

Finish in less time: You can finish your MAcc in less time than an MBA. At TROY, you can complete your master of accountancy in as little as a year.

The Director of Procurement and Asset Management is responsible for the development of policies and procedures designed to create an efficient and effective asset management environment for the University. The goal of Asset Management is to insure that purchases, dispositions, and transfers are made in accordance with Institutional requirements, applicable state and federal laws and any other statutory guidelines that are inherent to the cash management environment for assets. There are three types of purchasing alternatives expressly approved by Troy University: Most University purchases will fall within one of the categories listed above. 1. Some purchases may be made directly by the department and do not require a purchase order. Note: If a vendor requires a purchase order for any purchase or if the department desires a purchase order, follow the standard procedures for processing a requisition in the Purchasing Module of Datatel. 2. Purchases of less than $500.00 usually do not require a purchase order and can be paid using the Accounts Payable Check Request Form.

Sometimes an item is available from only one source. In order to justify purchasing based on “sole source” status of a vendor, you must provide adequate documentation from the vendor with your request to waive the bid process. The Director of Procurement will review your documentation to determine if the “sole source” justification is adequate and appropriate. Your written justification should describe the technical characteristics of the item as well as why those characteristics are essential and cannot be obtained from any other source. This information should also include documentation from the vendor which adequately describes the proprietary nature if the item. In the event “sole source” status is accepted, the purchase price of the item should be negotiated to receive the best terms/pricing possible. If you have questions regarding the Alabama Competitive Bid Process, please contact the Purchasing Department. In compliance with Alabama State Law Act 2001-955, Sections (1), (2) and (3), Troy University requires the disclosure of certain information regarding vendors and their relationships with Troy University. Vendors should be advised that in submitting their bid, contract proposal, they affirm under oath that no such relationships exist. If the intended or actual contract value exceeds $5000.00, they should complete a detailed Vendor Disclosure Statement and submit it to the Purchasing Department. In the event of competitive bids, this disclosure is only required from the winning vendor. Contracts will not be awarded to any person who refuses to disclose required information if such relationships exist. Departments should be aware that this law applies to ALL vendors with whom a contract which exceeds $5,000.00 (including those items submitted on a check request). All vendors are also required to submit a W-9 form to the Purchasing Department. Each department will be responsible for requesting this from the vendor. For your convenience, the form is available on the Financial Affairs and Online Education website under “Financial Affairs Division Forms”. Payment for goods and services will not be made to any vendor until this process has been satisfied. Troy University requests that vendors complete TROY's RSA/TSA Acknowledgement form. The form seeks information related to a business' employment of RSA/TSA retirees. RSA/TSA retirees must disclose to RSA/TSA potential conflict related to RSA/TSA beneficiary policies. Any University employee involved in purchasing goods or services must comply with the National Association of Educational Buyers (NAEB) Code of Ethics which includes the following: When making any purchase which will require shipping – you should have a complete understanding of whether shipping charges are to be paid by the supplier or the department. Your purchase requisition should include the approximate carrying charges to be paid by the department. When possible, avoid paying freight by specifying FOB location. Emergencies: are defined as circumstances in which action is needed to protect the health and welfare of personnel and students and to prevent further damage to property. FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE A NEED IS NOT, OF ITSELF, CONSIDERED A BONAFIDE EMERGENCY! WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO CORRECT A FORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.

Exceptions are: Forward all documentation for PREPAYMENT to the Director of Procurement and Asset Management for processing. DO NOT FORWARD REQUESTS FOR PREPAYMENTS TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. Any price quotations you receive from vendors are considered informal and are for information purposes only. Only the Purchasing Department can issue formal and binding bids/quotes. On many occasions, the information provided to you by the vendor may contain certain terms or language that the University cannot comply with. The Purchasing Department will insure that our terms and conditions are formalized with the vendor. Do not commit to a purchase verbally or in writing until it has been authorized by following standard purchasing procedures. If you have a complaint about a vendor, please contact the Purchasing Department at Ext 13402. 1. Vendor samples may be accepted by University departments only under certain circumstances.2. The product will be needed by the University. Do not accept products that will probably not be purchased. 3. Samples are not for personal use. 4. The sample is relatively small and of low dollar value. Samples are for examination purposes and not added to inventory. 5. If a sample is accepted it should be promptly conveyed to the appropriate department for testing, and the vendor provided with a prompt evaluation. Sometimes vendors, such as Quill, offer premiums with orders that exceed a certain dollar level or with orders of specifically marketed items. Employees of the University are not allowed to profit at the expense of University funds. If, at any time, premiums are received as a result of a vendor promotion, the gift must be forwarded to the Purchasing Department.",https://www.troy.edu/about-us/offices-departments/purchasing-asset-management/asset-management/index.html

I have taught high school in Georgia and Alabama for 42 years, but I am now retired; however, I do not want to lose the opportunity to interact with young adults as we share literature and writing. My hobby involves any aspect of remodeling buildings; it is trilling to transform ugly into beautiful. My two children, ages 38 and 34, are a joy. Though I have no grandchildren yet, I enjoy interacting with our horses, a blue heeler, and cats. It is my goal in teaching to assist all students, regardless of their intended purpose for taking my classes, to grow academically on their way to reaching their goals.

Exhibitions,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Rosa Parks Museum will host returning artist V.L. Cox's A Still, Small Voice exhibit. Cox was reminded of the Nina Simone quote, “How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?” and used that as her guiding principle while developing this exhibition. She took the title A Still Small Voice from 1 Kings 19:11-13 in the Christian Bible that references the whispered voice of God during a difficult moral choice. This exhibition examines how religion in the United States has played, and continues to play, a major role in Civil Rights and Social Justice movements…both as a positive and negative. The pieces included in A Still Small Voice reflect the dichotomy of how religion, both historically and contemporarily, is used to defend systems of belief. One aspect of the exhibition depicts how the religious tenets of faith, love, and unity compelled leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lewis and sustained the masses of civil rights/social justice protestors, while the other side of white supremacists, Christian nationalists, and the Ku Klux Klan often uses religion to justify their hate, xenophobia, and deemed superiority. This exhibition embraces the message that separate or second-class status is never equal, and cruelty is where we, as decent human beings, must draw the line and simply love one another. Reception and Artist Meet-and-Greet: Thursday, November 14th, 6:00PM-7:30PM Exhibit runs November 14th, 2024, through June 21st, 2025.

FAQ,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The only time anyone in the program incurs a commitment to the Air Force or Space Force is if they have signed a contract with the Air Force or Space Force. Contracts are only signed to accept an AFROTC scholarship or for a student to join the POC following Field Training. All other students can walk away from the program at any time without incurring a financial or military obligation. Application into AFROTC at Troy University begins with enrollment into your first classes, AS1112/ASL112. All freshmen will enroll in these classes, but sophomore and transfer students will need to speak with the Recruiting Officer to lay out the remainder of your academic plan to graduation and commissioning. Contact the detachment to make an appointment – 334-670-3866. The program requires a minimum of six semesters to get a student to commissioning. You will have to sit down with the Recruiting Officer to see how many credit hours you have left in your undergraduate degree. As long as you have six semesters worth of credit hours left in your degree program, you can join the program as an AS250 student and take your AS100 and AS200 classes at the same time. The same rules apply to transfer students as does rules for Troy students not previously enrolled in AFROTC. We need a minimum of six semesters to get students all the way through the AFROTC curriculum. For specific questions, contact the Recruiting Flight Commander – 334-670-3866. To qualify for the General Military Course (your first two years in AFROTC), you must: You must maintain these standards while in Air Force ROTC: After graduating from college and completing all Air Force ROTC requirements, you'll be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force. Non-rated officers serve 4 years on active duty, flying rated officers serve 6-10 years after training. Leadership Lab is a cadet-run program taken each semester of cadet participation in AFROTC. POC, or upper class, cadets plan, manage, and execute LLAB activities each week. LLAB is a two-hour course that you will register for each semester with Troy University. It is a pass/fail course with the university and requires successful completion in order to move forward in the AFROTC program. In short, LLAB is the hands-on version of what you learn about in your Air Force class. Yes, absolutely! Most students who enter the program do so without a scholarship. We will work hard to qualify you for potential in-college scholarships, if you so desire. You will compete in a selection process that rank orders you amongst all the cadets seeking Air Force jobs in your graduation year. The factors to be used will include your AFOQT scores, your field training performance rating, your GPA, your academic major, your Physical Fitness Assessment score and the Detachment Commander's rating. You will also be asked to rank order your desired career fields in the Air Force, and YES, they do look at your preferences. You will know your specific Air Force job category approximately one year before you are commissioned. The Air Force is in the business of flying, but not everyone in the Air Force flies planes. Besides pilots and navigators, there are cyberwarfare officers, missile launch officers, airfield management, pre-health, nursing, and other technical and non-technical career fields. Nearly every career area found in the civilian economy is also found in the Air Force. To get a better idea of how many jobs are available to you, see the main Air Force website at www.airforce.com. Uniforms are free of charge and will be issued to students as certain milestones are completed during the school year. Cadets are responsible to keep their uniform clean and presentable. You're required to wear your uniform any day that you have Leadership Lab, as well as during your weekly ROTC class period as directed by your leadership. There are also certain military events (Dining-Out, Dining-In, Base visits, etc.) that require uniform wear.

Education Preparation Provider (EPP) Data,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University’s College of Education is committed as an Education Preparation Provider (EPP) to prepare and develop informed, innovative, reflective, globally-minded and effective professional teacher candidates. Candidate performance is carefully monitored at various milestones during their program to promote positive student learning outcomes. Troy University’s College of Education, in accordance with our various accreditation and assessment measures, seek to demonstrate our candidates’ accountability and provide transparent data concerning student performance. This is facilitated not only by our academic excellence in the areas of educator preparation for licensure, but is enhanced further by many hours of clinical field experience within a diverse range of schools and educational institutions. Programs in the Department of Teacher Education are accredited through various organizations. Troy University: Recognized for Excellence College of Education Department of Teacher Education Undergraduate and Initial Certification Programs are accredited through the following: Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) reviewed and fully accredited all programs except the music programs National Association of Schools of Music reviewed and full accredited the Music Education Programs.

The EPP has struggled to collect data. Multiple options have been utilized from recruiting volunteers of completers (graduates) from 0-3 years from graduation to working with schools systems to collect data. Inviting volunteers from the Follow-Up Survey for Graduates and from one large size school system, we were able to solicit volunteers but no data was submitted. While the EPP knows who the volunteers are, we do not who submits the data. The EPP needs to provide follow-up contact with the volunteers. Plan for the 2024-2025 data collection is to have program coordinators contacting their completers to solicit data. Middle and high school systems do not implement the progress monitoring software. For the next year middle and high school completers will administer pre- and post-test tests to provide student learning data. The university has added the feature upload files feature to Qualtrics (data collection software). It may be easier for volunteers to upload documents with names and school redacted than to manually enter data. Data collection had decreased for the 2022-2023 school year. Previous data collections can be reviewed by academic year using the links on the right side. We were only able to collect limited achievement scores from completers of ECE and ELE programs. This assessment is the end-of-the-year state achievement test, the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP), is an online assessment designed to provide stakeholders (parents, teachers, educators and community members) with information regarding student progress toward mastery of the Alabama Course of Study Standards. This assessment is administered during Spring within the test window options. N= 4 ECE teachers with a total of 80 students. One cycle of data was submitted. Because two sets of data per teacher were not submitted, the data shows they percentage of students in the below proficiency category and at or above proficiency N=12 ELE teachers with a total of 249 students. One cycle of data was submitted. Because two sets of data per teacher were not submitted, the data shows they percentage of students in the below proficiency category and at or above proficiency This chart with shows more students are scoring at or above proficiency for these completers. However, we must include the next administration of the assessments to understand the trajectory of the learning growth of students. This is one snapshot of learning in the classrooms of Troy completers in two programs. We continue to struggle to obtain data. However, the assessment committee is working on a new plan of action to increase the number of completers from all programs and the amount of data obtained. ECE Grade 2 ELE Grades 2-6 4 12 80 249 ELA Below Proficiency 47.5% 35% ELA At Proficient or Above Proficiency 52.5% 65% Math Below Proficiency 37.5% 48% Math-At Proficient or Above Proficiency 62.5% 52% Number of students taking the Science ACAP Not administered in primary grades 127 Science Below Proficiency 39% Science- At Proficient or Above Proficiency 61% Focus Group Interview One ECE ALT-A completer participated in the interview. Although this is only one person and does not represent all programs, it provided a deeper understanding of the impact completers have on P-12 student-learning growth. This completer was candid, providing suggestions to improve the program and commending faculty and instructional practices that helped them to positively impact student learning. However, when they were asked how they know they have a positive impact on P-12 student learning, this individual stated the scores of students increased. Specific students who were below grade level and how they made great gains to reach benchmark or almost reaching benchmark. 88.23% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded believe Very Well to Extremely Well that they are prepared to impact P-12 student learning. This has increased significantly from the previous year. As we look over time, responses from After reviewing the data from previous surveys and the survey for the current year, data shows the pandemic may have had a negative impact on completer’s beliefs of their impact on student learning but completer's are feeling more confident in their abilities now. 2023 Completer Survey 86.67% of employers who responded to the 2022-2023 survey stated completers were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to impact P-12 Student Learning. 2022-2023 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENT: Love working with Troy U and the teachers you produce!! 2022-2023 Employer Survey 2022-2023 EMPLOYER FOCUS GROUP COMMENT: Both interviewed administrators strongly stated that Troy does a wonderful job preparing teachers for content and student achievement. This is verified by the increase in ACAP scores. One large school system that hires many of our graduates from all programs shared completed teacher evaluations from the administrators at 8 schools ranging from early childhood to high school. This large school system hires many of our graduates from all programs. These evaluations conducted by administrators utilized a proprietary protocol. This observation tool evaluates teacher behaviors that influence P-12 learning and administrator comments included student behaviors. Observations are scored 0-Ineffective, 1-Developing, 2-Effective, 3-Exemplary. With less than 10 individuals listed most programs (indicated by an *), the EPP categorized the programs into Early Childhood and Elementary and Secondary (Middle school to high school).

The Classroom Management indicator mean score was just below 2.0- effectiveness at 1.81, corroborating data from completer and employer surveys. However, the score for the secondary completers was lower overall at 1.68. Although all programs are not represented separately in this data collection, scores indicate TROY completers have a positive influence on effective P-12 student learning. Comments from the administrators on strengths and weaknesses included: Early Childhood*, Elementary Collab K-6* Art*, Science*, Math*, History*, ELA* The summary of growth/focus will be used as suggestions to improve the programs at TROY. The Summary of Strengths will be included as strengths in the programs to maintain. Data suggests the EPP completers have a positive impact on P12 student learning. While data collected is still too small to make conclusive results, the EPP remains diligent to increase the number of student data and teacher evaluations by increasing the number of partner schools who will provide the data. Two new school systems will provide data for the 2022-2023 school year. With a new Director of the Certification and Field Experience Office, partnerships will be re-established and stronger with consistent leadership. Her staff have been developing databases, visiting school systems, and talking with P12 school administration. One action that was started prior to the pandemic was adding a volunteer opportunity to completers taking the Completer survey. They can volunteer to provide pre- and post-test data. Once individuals add their contact information, an email is sent to them with the data request, with a link to add the data to a Qualtrics form. With partner schools joining us in the data collection, having school administration send out the email will make it more likely for completers to open the email and then decide if they would like to help the EPP. With the school system sending it out, completers know the school system has approved the data sharing. 2022-2023 EMPLOYER SURVEY 2022-2023 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENT Love working with Troy U and the teachers you produce!! 2022-2023 Employer Survey 2023 Educator Preparation Institutional Report Card for Performance on Required Content Knowledge and Pedagogy Tests and Responses to the First and Second Year Teacher Survey created by the Alabama Association of Colleges for Teacher Education for Troy University.

Troy University’s online MS in Education is a 36-credit program designed for practicing teachers in public or private school settings. Courses are 100 percent online – though some courses are also available on campus for students who prefer a hybrid program. Troy’s program also allows for flexible course planning, so that students are not confined to regimented course sequences and can take full- or part-time course loads. All teacher education certification programs are approved by the Alabama State Department of Education. The U.S. Department of Education reports that high-quality teacher preparation can make a dramatic impact on student outcomes – even outweighing negative factors like poverty. 81.82% of employers would hire more Troy University Completers.

The following diversity categories with completer ratings are: SURVEY COMMENTS 2022-2023 Employer Survey The purpose of all certification programs in the College of Education is to develop practicing master teachers, instructional support personnel, and education specialists who more effectively serve students in P-12 settings. As master teachers, instructional support personnel, and education specialists, they participate as leaders in their schools and contribute to their profession. Each candidate completes the state approved checklist for their particular program. Based on the recommendation to ALSDE, derived from the completion of the R & R/Review & Recommendation for Application Based on Completion of an Alabama Class A Program and Class AA Program and the Supplemental NA1/Recommendation for Certification forms, all completed. We have 8 completers who have not submitted certification paperwork. Two reasons have been uncovered as to why completers may not meet licensure requirements. One reason is that they have not submitted their licensure paperwork in a timely manner. Therefore, the submission shows up for the next academic year or years later. Another reason completers may not meet licensure requirements is that they have not been able to pass the Praxis exam in their field required by the Alabama State Department of Education. These individuals would not submit paperwork until they meet requirements or remember to complete the paperwork. Sometimes, these individuals submit paperwork during the next data collection cycle. The EPP discovered that graduates are not required to have certification in order to get the pay raise for the higher degree. Some completers submit an Official Transcript to the HR department at their schools to receive the pay raise & forget to complete process for certification. To remind candidates of the process, advanced programs started adding an addendum to syllabi to remind students to submit certification paper. Programs with internships/practicums include details about the certification process in a handbook. 89.66% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed full-time teaching. 3.45% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed outside of the teaching field. 6.90% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were not employed outside of the home. Some teaching field positions have limited openings. Teachers will earn their certification in another field in order to be ready to apply and be hired when there is an opening. For example, the number of gifted specialists in a school system are low. General education teachers will earn gifted certification to be eligible to be hired when a position opens up or a new one is created. 2022-2023 Completer Survey 81.82% of employers’ responding to the P-12 Employer Satisfaction Survey would continue to hire Troy graduates. 86.21% of Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher Completers that responded feel Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to Impact P-12 Student Learning 85.18% of Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher Completers that responded feel Very Well to Extremely Well to be an effective teacher.

Quality Enhancement Plan 2020,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Reinforcing Troy University’s position as Alabama’s International Institution will occur through the implementation of two independent yet complementary global-focus initiatives. Described in greater detail below, these initiatives are mutually supportive of the QEP’s focus and intended outcomes. Focused on developing the international awareness and global preparedness of students, the “Global Scholar” Initiative will complement the existing University Honors program with a globally focused major-specific track developed within and by each of Troy University’s five colleges. The Global Scholar Initiative will be available to students on the Troy Campus initially. The goal of the program is to enhance global awareness of students interested in completing Troy University’s Global Scholar Program. We will train select cohorts of students to become more globally aware, and therefore prepared, to pursue careers or graduate opportunities in an international environment. Focused on faculty, staff, and administrator development, the QEP committee or designates will establish a “Global Awareness and Inter-Cultural Competency” Initiative. This multi-faceted program will, in part, develop training for faculty, staff and administrators that facilitates interaction and understanding between Troy University employees and international students. This opportunity will be available to faculty at all locations. Upon successful completion of the training, the participant will be expected to be more sensitive to and have a better understanding of the unique needs and issues our international students face, which should result in an improved Troy University experience for international students. 011 Adams Administration BuildingTroy, Alabama 36082Phone: 334-670-3803Fax: 334-670-3815",https://www.troy.edu/about-us/offices-departments/institutional-research-planning-effectiveness/quality-enhancement-plan/index.html

IRPE Historical Highlights,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University traces its origin to the Troy State Normal School which was established on 26 February 1887, by an Act of the Alabama Legislature. Recognizing the growth of the school's programs, the State Board of Education in 1929 changed the name of the School to Troy State Teachers College, and in 1931, the College granted its first baccalaureate degree. Continued growth in the College's programs prompted the Alabama legislature in 1957 to change the name to Troy State College, and in the same year, the State Board of Education authorized the master's degree program. On 14 December 1967, Troy State College was officially renamed Troy State University. Responding to the needs of the people of the area, Troy State University established a center at Fort Rucker in 1961 and another center in Montgomery at Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in 1965. These centers became degree-granting branches of Troy State University in 1966. TSU at Montgomery in 1983 and TSU at Dothan in 1985 were accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the associate degree, the bachelor's degree, the master's degree, and the educational specialist degree. Since 1966, Troy State University has established a branch at Phenix City and under the aegis of TROY Service Centers, offers degree programs at a number of locations in the United States and around the world. In August 2005, Troy State University officially became one University—Troy University—and consists of the merged campuses and sites related to Troy State University (TSU), Troy State University Dothan (TSUD), and Troy State University Montgomery (TSUM). This merger was approved by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) in December 2004 and by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) and Board of Trustees (BOT) in 2005. 011 Adams Administration BuildingTroy, Alabama 36082Phone: 334-670-3803Fax: 334-670-3815",https://www.troy.edu/about-us/offices-departments/institutional-research-planning-effectiveness/fact-site/historical.html

After eight weeks of training, the program culminated in a pitch competition. Alden Barentine, a junior accounting major, won with his pitch for 12:5 Coffee, a mobile coffee business. Barentine recently reported that he was able to use his earnings to purchase a home coffee roaster to ""learn the ins and outs of roasting, and gain some valuable experience before going commercial."" Entrepreneurs must possess unique willpower and a can-do attitude to succeed. Entrepreneurial ventures are risky and there is no one-size-fits-all approach, but an idea will remain an idea if the person behind it does not have the confidence and willingness to jump right in. At the IDEA Bank, we will instill pride in being different, cultivate a spirit of risk-taking, and encourage disruption. We encourage students to lean into their ideas and believe in themselves. Sorrell College offers both an Entrepreneurship Minor and Major concentration with the frameworks, courses, and theories to ensure students are grounded in both fundamental and innovative principles needed to move forward. While there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach, the IDEA Bank empowers a curriculum that supplies students with the foundation needed to perfect their craft. The learning does not stop with the academic curriculum. Special workshops, niche brainstorming sessions, mentorship-matching, guest speakers, community collaboration, and real-life projects are crucial aspects of the IDEA Bank's operation that allow young entrepreneurs to explore the opportunities associated with their ideas. The goal for all student entrepreneurs is to launch their ideas. The IDEA Bank prioritizes hands-on collaboration with faculty, staff, community members, alumni, and more, to provide the support system that students need to apply their inspiration, learning, and exploration to the full development and application of their ideas.

The Hall School of Journalism and Communication and Troy University can enhance those opportunities. From media symposia and workshops to lectures, plays, concerts and Division I athletics, students here can learn outside, as well as inside, the classroom. And that outside has become much bigger for Troy University. With a growing number of international students, as well as more and more chances to study abroad, the world has opened up for Troy students in ways not possible just a decade ago. The opportunities don't stop at graduation. The Journalism Alumni Association, for instance, helps graduates with networking and careers. It also provides a sure way to stay connected to Troy University and its graduates. In short, I believe the Hall School of Journalism and Communication and Troy University are rich with opportunity. And we'd like to share that with you because college is not about missed opportunities but explored opportunities. I hope that after you explore Troy University's world of journalism and communication education, you will allow us to have the opportunity to work with you in the Hall School of Journalism and Communication.

Aviation Operations Minor,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Aviation Operations Minor at Troy University is a minor for a specific set of students who will be incorporating flight training and private piloting into their future careers. TROY’s Aviation Operations Minor is an 18-credit-hour program with a Fixed Wing Emphasis. Equivalent credit toward the completion of the Aviation Operations Minor/Fixed Wing Emphasis may be earned through Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and licensure in such areas as private pilot, commercial pilot and flight instruction. Once the flight training is completed for all the necessary ground instructions and the FAA certifications have been issued, these certifications (in total) are accepted as satisfying the Aviation Operations Minor in Flight at Troy University. This minor can be used with any undergraduate major which requires a minor and can also be used by a student to fulfill requirements for an associate degree. Private Pilot License: As there are no Troy University flight classes, TROY has partnered with SkyWarrior, a flight school in Troy, Alabama, that operates its headquarters out of Pensacola, Florida. SkyWarrior Flight School is available for scheduling and completing the flight lessons. However, any flight school which offers courses leading to FAA certification would be acceptable for use with the Aviation Operations Minor at Troy University. The job outlook for pilots in the future is strong and with this minor you can complete aviation certifications while still pursuing your major coursework, which is unique to Troy University.

Chemistry Internships,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Chase Ledbetter will be working on ""X-ray scintillators based on low dimensional perovskites"" project at Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL this summer. ""Developing technologies for the detection of X-ray radiation is an important area of research for their wide applications in security and heath areas. Current technologies for X-ray detection rely on scintillation from expensive inorganic crystals prepared at high-temperature. Recently, solution processed metal halide perovskite single crystals have been used to construct scintillators for X-ray, thanks to their efficient X-ray absorption and excellent optical properties. However, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of bulk perovskite single crystals is low, due to defects, self- absorption and quenching, and many other nonradiative decay channels. The Ma group has pioneered research in molecular level low dimensional organometal halide perovskites, which can be prepared in large single crystals by low cost wet-chemistry approaches to exhibit superior luminescent properties with PLQEs of up to 100%. This new class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials with exceptional structural and property tenability have potential applications in luminescence based optical sensors, including X-ray scintillators. The REU students will be working with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Ma group to develop and study new low dimensional perovskite materials for X-ray detection. The students will synthesize 2-3 zero-dimensional organometal halide perovskites (4 weeks), characterize their structural and optical properties, using single crystal crystallography and optical spectroscopies (3 weeks), test their X-ray detection capability (2 weeks), write a report and prepare oral and poster presentations (1 week)"".

Physics/Astrophysics,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The BIS in Astrophysics includes fulfilling the requirements for a minor in math, physics and astronomy and astrophysics along with the standard general studies curriculum. In addition to employment in the public/private sector (see below under physics), this program prepares students to continue their graduate education in mathematics, physics, astronomy, and astrophysics. The Center for Relativity and Cosmology at Troy University will play a pivotal role in your training. Beyond the required courses, you may choose to take advanced courses in relativity, computational physics, and quantum mechanics, just to name a few, in the Area V portion of your curriculum. The BIS in astrophysics will serve as the flagship program in this area. Students interested in the BIS in astrophysics should reach out directly to the department here. Physics is the most fundamental of the sciences. The theories and laws of physics attempt to give a complete description of the observable and measurable universe, while experiments are conducted to test these theories and occasionally to make discoveries that are beyond them. The observable universe appears to follow the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, the details are not fixed: new particles/fields are predicted and then sometimes observed—the Higgs boson is a recent example, as is the detection of gravitational waves—while other predictions await verification. Alternatively, observations are made that provide evidence for phenomena that are not accounted for in the standard model: dark matter and dark energy are hypotheses for observation that fall into this category. In addition to the primarily academic interests of physics, there are several practical applications and a variety of technologies that can be developed from these principles. For example, the principles used to develop large particle colliders like the LHC are also used to make particle accelerators for radiation therapy and deposition techniques for computer chips. Physics has applications in superconductivity, materials science, quantum computing, thin-film production, spintronics, medical physics, and electronics (just to name a few). The list here is endless, and can indeed extend into the other sciences. There is much work yet to be done, and most of this will fall into the hands of the future generation of physicists. Physicists/Astrophysicists find work in high-tech companies/institutions like NASA, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Intel, IBM, Amazon, Pandora, GE, AT&T, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Google (once again, just to name a few). The national research labs and the military seek physicists to develop the next generation of technology. Then there are the career physicists/astrophysicists who seek employment in various research and teaching universities. Beyond the technical industries, physicists and astrophysicists with a computational background are coveted in the financial market space.

Hall-Waters Prize,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Renowned poet Terrance Hayes, a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Genius Award recipient and a National Book Award winner, will receive the Hall-Waters Prize from Troy University on April 28. Hayes, who is currently professor of English at New York University, will present selections from his forthcoming collection, So to Speak (July 2023), and his award-winning 2018 collection, American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin, at 10 a.m. in Janice Hawkins Cultural Arts Park on the Troy Campus. Admission is free and open to the public. In case of rain, the reading will be held in the Claudia Crosby Theater. The Hall-Waters Prize is endowed by TROY alumnus Dr. Wade Hall, an author, former member of the faculty at the University of Florida and professor emeritus of English at Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY. Dr. Hall, a native of Bullock County, endowed the prize as a memorial to his parents, Wade Hall Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth Waters Hall. The award is presented regularly to a person who has made significant contributions to Southern heritage and culture in history, literature or the arts. “Terrance Hayes is an astonishingly versatile poet and essayist whose work testifies both to the value of tradition and to the salience of contemporary popular culture,” said Dr. Kirk Curnutt, chair of English at Troy University. “His seven poetry collections and two collections of essays really capture the beauty that arises when vernacular is set within the framework of experimental cadences and established forms, adding mystery and intensity to everyday issues of identity, family, and commitment. His work is wonderfully accessible and yet dignified both by formality and urgency in a way that makes them impossible to walk away from—they linger in the mind. It is not every day at Troy University that we are visited by someone who is both a MacArthur “genius grant” recipient and a National Book Award winner, not to mention his many other honors. Our students are very excited to meet one of the leading lights in American poetry.” Hayes is the author of seven poetry collections: So to Speak; American Sonnets for My Past And Future Assassin, a finalist for the National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, and TS Eliot Prize; How to Be Drawn; Lighthead, winner of the 2010 National Book Award for poetry; Muscular Music, recipient of the Kate Tufts Discovery Award; Hip Logic, winner of the 2001 National Poetry Series, and Wind in a Box. His prose collection, To Float In the Space Between: Drawings and Essays in Conversation with Etheridge Knight, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and winner of the Pegasus Award for Poetry Criticism. Most recently, Watch Your Language (2023) is a collection of graphic reviews, illustrated prose, and visualized poetics addressing the last century of American poetry. Past winners include Rep. John Lewis, Bobbie Ann Mason, Pat Conroy, Natasha Trethewey, Cassandra King, Ace Atkins, and the songwriting team of Dan Pan and Spooner Oldham, among others. For the second straight year, English majors in Dr. Curnutt’s English 4495 senior seminar are organizing the Hall-Waters ceremony, from picking the menu and writing the award citation to publicizing the event. “The hands-on experience students gain in putting a ceremony like this together positions them perfectly for future employment either in publishing, literary tourism, or arts management,” Curnutt said. “We already know our majors are excellent creative artists. This event gives them an opportunity to demonstrate that they know how to put on an exciting, memorable show.” Renowned author Michelle Richmond, a Mobile, Ala. native whose recent novel The Wonder Test has been hailed as a “gripping thriller” and witty satire of “high-stakes education,” will receive Troy University’s Hall-Waters Prize on April 14. Richmond will discuss the evolution of her career from her debut short-story collection, The Girl in the Fall-Away Dress (2001) through such bestsellers as The Year of Fog (2007) and The Marriage Pact (2017), at 9:30 a.m. in the Lamar P. Higgins Ballroom in the Trojan Center on the Troy Campus. The event is free and open to the public. The Hall-Waters Prize is endowed by TROY alumnus Dr. Wade Hall, an author, former member of the faculty at the University of Florida and professor emeritus of English at Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY. Dr. Hall, a native of Bullock County, endowed the prize as a memorial to his parents, Wade Hall Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth Waters Hall. The award is presented regularly to a person who has made significant contributions to Southern heritage and culture in history, literature or the arts. “Michelle Richmond is a brilliant writer who walks a great line between satirizing social obsessions like marriage, education, and crime without sacrificing the empathy readers want to feel for characters,” said Dr. Kirk Curnutt, Chair of English at Troy University. “Her novels are at once rich in setting, encompassing both her native Alabama and more recently California, where she lives now, and yet intricate in plots that are both complex and heart-pounding.” Richmond’s most recent novel, The Wonder Test, introduces a new protagonist, FBI Agent Lina Connerly. “FBI agent Lina Connerly promises to become the star of a fictional franchise every bit as interesting as Patricia Cornwell’s Kay Scarpetta series or Karin Slaughter’s Dr. Sara Linton novels,” Curnutt said. “It’s not easy to create a sleuth or crime solver whose interior life is as compelling as the thrillers she’s inveigled in, but with Lina, Michelle has accomplished that wonderfully. I can’t wait for the next Lina novel.” Richmond was raised in Mobile and graduated from the University of Alabama with degrees in English and journalism. While pursuing an Master of Fine Arts in creative writing at the University of Arkansas, she met her future husband, Kevin, and relocated to the University of Miami. After stints in sales and advertising in New York City, she relocated to Beijing, China, an experience that inspired her first novel, The Dream of the Blue Room (2003). Eventually, she and her family relocated to the suburbs of her husband’s native Northern California, where the clashing political cultures of hi-tech, wellness and fitness, and gentrification have inspired her recent work. In addition to a new novel, she is currently writing a memoir about expatriate life during the pandemic in Paris, where she spent most of 2019-2021. This year’s ceremony is particularly notable for the lead taken by English majors in Dr. Curnutt’s English 4495, senior seminar, organizing the event. “We’re trying to give our majors practical, hands-on experience in publishing, literary tourism, and arts management,” Curnutt said. “The Hall-Waters Prize is a great opportunity for our students to step up and discover what it takes to host a public event, from curating an award to publicizing and promoting an author’s appearance. After April 14, they’ll be able to walk into any organization and host an event with aplomb.” Renowned author and songwriter Allison Moorer received Troy University’s Hall-Waters Prize during a virtual ceremony. Moorer, an Academy Award-nominee whose recent memoir, “Blood,” has been heralded as a frank and cathartic memoir of family and healing, is a leading voice in country, folk and Americana music and has written hit songs for artists such as Trisha Yearwood, Kenny Chesney and Miranda Lambert. The ceremony, which was originally scheduled for an in-person event on the Troy Campus was moved online following the cancellation of campus events due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Plans for a fall event that would bring Moorer to campus are under way. The Hall-Waters Prize is endowed by TROY alumnus Dr. Wade Hall, an author, former member of the faculty at the University of Florida and professor emeritus of English at Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY. Dr. Hall, a native of Bullock County, endowed the prize as a memorial to his parents, Wade Hall Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth Waters Hall. The award is presented regularly to a person who has made significant contributions to Southern heritage and culture in history, literature or the arts. Past winners include Rep. John Lewis, Bobbie Ann Mason, Pat Conroy, Natasha Trethewey, Cassandra King, Ace Atkins, and the songwriting team of Dan Pan and Spooner Oldham, among others. Maj. Gen. Walter Givhan, Senior Vice Chancellor for Advancement and Economic Development, presented the award to Moorer via video conference. “We are so proud to have this opportunity to present the Hall-Waters Prize to singer, songwriter and author Allison Moorer,” Givhan said. “That Alabama voice truly comes through, not just in her songs, but also in her written work. Her memoir, ‘Blood,’ is what we are honoring here today and what a work it is. What an accomplishment it is to bring the written word together with music for a complete and total experience. We are doing this presentation virtually here today, but we cannot wait to have Allison come to TROY and have the opportunity to interact with our students, faculty and staff.” Moorer said she was extremely honored to receive the award, especially since it recognizes the work of Southern artists. “I’ve always been and will continue to be a very proud Southerner. It’s in me. It’s who I am, so I’m delighted that this award is given to honor works of a Southerner,” Moorer said from her home in Nashville. “The people who have received the award before me, I’m just in awe of and I can’t believe I get to be in such company. It means a lot to me to receive this award, and especially now when I feel like our lives are so different and who knows what we are going to emerge to. To have something like this happen during these times is a real bright spot.” Moorer said the feedback she has received from her book and accompanying album is very rewarding. “So much of the reward for me has been in the feedback I’ve gotten from people who have read the book or listened to the record or both,” she said. “That I’m able to help anyone in any way means that I have done good work, and, above all, I want to be of some sort of service to the world. It makes me feel good on another level to know that my work is being recognized by a University. It makes me feel that maybe my work has merit on a literary level as well.” Moorer first gained fame when her debut single, “A Soft Place to Fall,” co-written with Gwil Owen, was featured in the Robert Redford-directed film “The Horse Whisperer.” The composition was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1999, leading to her performing it live at that year’s Oscar ceremonies. The title track of the album from which it came, “Alabama Song,” demonstrates the artist’s deep connection to her native state and in particular to Mobile, where she was born, and to Frankville and Monroeville, where she was raised. Over the course of her subsequent nine albums, Moorer has diversified from mainstream country into pop, folk, and finally into Americana/roots music, where she is widely hailed for her earthy vocals and narrative approach to lyrics. While most of her albums feature her original songs, she has released two celebrated collections of covers, including 2017’s “Not Dark Yet,” on which she and her sister reinterpret Bob Dylan, Kurt Cobain, and Merle Haggard. Following the presentation, Dr. Kirk Curnutt, Chair of TROY’s Department of English, conducted an in-depth interview with Moorer focusing on her memoir, “Blood.” The full production will appear on the University’s social media next week. “One central goal of the Hall-Waters Prize has always been to celebrate the versatility of writing, to appreciate that words might be recorded on paper or they might be performed live but that regardless of format great art consoles human sorrows and uplifts grief through the craft of language,” Dr. Curnutt said. “We’re very excited to celebrate Ms. Moorer’s work, and we cannot wait to have her come to Troy, when we are able to schedule a visit, to speak with our students.” Troy University is proud to announce that the recipients of the 2019 Hall-Waters Prize for Excellence in Southern Writing are the songwriting duo of Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham. Once described by The Independent as a ""two-man soul hit factory,"" Dan and Spooner collaborated upon several of the defining American soul-pop songs of the 1960s and 1970s. From their first collaboration, Joe Simon's ""Let's Do It Over"" (four months in the Top 20 in 1965) on through Janis Joplin's seminal performance of their ""A Woman Left Lonely"" on her posthumously released classic ""Pearl,"" the duo helped define contemporary Southern music as composers, musicians and producers. Spooner and Dan will spend Friday, April 12, in Troy meeting with students and talking about the craft of songwriting, while on Saturday they'll appear together to discuss their careers, both as a team and individually, in the South Tent. This is your chance to meet two keystones of the Muscle Shoals sound! Renowned songwriters Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, two linchpins of the Muscle Shoals music scene that helped define the soul, pop and rock music of the 1960s and 1970s, will receive the Hall-Waters Prize from Troy University on April 12. The duo will discuss the craft of songwriting, the history of Southern music and the special role of Muscle Shoals in American popular culture from 10-11:30 a.m. in John M. Long Hall Room 104, on the Troy Campus. Admission is free and open to the public. The following day, Penn and Oldham will speak at the Alabama Book Festival in Montgomery before performing a concert that evening featuring the numerous hits they wrote for Janis Joplin, the Box Tops, and Aretha Franklin. “It’s amazing to look at Dan and Spooner’s credits and realize just how prolific and diverse they were during the heyday of Southern soul and rock,” said Dr. Kirk Curnutt, chair of English at Troy University and a co-director of the Alabama Book Festival, which Troy University co-sponsors with the Alabama Humanities Foundation, the Alabama State Council on the Arts, Old Alabama Town and several other state organizations. “They wrote ‘I’m Your Puppet’ for James and Bobby Purify, then ‘Cry Like a Baby’ for Alex Chilton’s Box Tops, two songs that sound like they come from opposite ends of that era’s musical spectrum.” The duo’s ability to create music stretching across many different musical styles truly stands out, Curnutt said. “More important is the sheer craft of their songs and the beauty with which they channel and synthesize so many veins of American music at once: rhythm and blues, gospel, country, soul, pop—you hear them all, sometimes all at once, in songs like ‘I Worship the Ground You Walk On,’ which Etta James among others recorded, or ‘Up Tight, Good Man,’ by Laura Lee,” Curnutt said. “Dan and Spooner’s songs crystalize so much of the American experience, and yet they feel as wide-open as America itself. Each of their songs, no matter how perfect the melody or precise the lyrics, provides space for the performer to reinvent the work and make it their own. You only need to listen to how Janis Joplin’s aching version of their ‘A Woman Left Lonely’ differs from Charlie Rich’s more country treatment to appreciate how flexible those tunes are.” Penn and Oldham are legendary figures beyond their collaborative efforts. Penn was still a teenager when a demo recorded with his band, Benny Cagle and the Rhythm Swingsters, called “Is a Bluebird Blue?” caught the ear of Conway Twitty, who made it a hit in 1959. At 20, he became the first in-house songwriter at FAME Studios (short for Florence Alabama Musical Enterprises) in the Shoals, working closely with founder Rick Hall. A few years later, Penn relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, where he wrote the classic “The Dark End of the Street” with Chips Moman and soon produced several hit albums and singles for the Box Tops, whose lead singer, 16-year-old Alex Chilton, later became of one of the most lionized cult figures in rock music. As the resident keyboardist for FAME Studios, Oldham remains one of rock’s most highly sought sidemen, earning him inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Musicians Hall of Fame and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Oldham performed on such classics as Percy Sledge’s “When a Man Loves a Woman” and Wilson Pickett’s “Mustang Sally,” while his proto-funk electric piano drives Aretha Franklin’s “I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You).” After relocating to Los Angeles, Oldham backed artists as diverse as Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, Neil Young and Bob Dylan. Since relocating back to Alabama, he has worked with Bettye Levette, the Drive-By Truckers and many more. Since the early 1990s, Penn and Oldham have occasionally toured together, performing selections from their vast repertoire. In 1999, they released ""Moments from This Theatre,"" a live recording described by allmusic.com as “an intimate and inspiring recording by two of the unsung giants of southern soul.” The pair come to Troy University to receive the Hall-Waters Prize after a March 2019 tour of Japan. The Hall-Waters Prize is endowed by TROY alumnus Dr. Wade Hall, an author, former member of the faculty at the University of Florida and professor emeritus of English at Bellarmine University in Louisville, Kentucky. Dr. Hall, a native of Bullock County, Alabama, endowed the prize as a memorial to his parents, Wade Hall Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth Waters Hall. The award is presented regularly to a person who has made significant contributions to Southern heritage and culture in history, literature or the arts. Past winners include Rep. John Lewis, Bobbie Ann Mason, Pat Conroy, Natasha Trethewey, Cassandra King and Ace Atkins, among others. Now in its 14th year, the Alabama Book Festival is a free event celebrating reading, literacy and the history of the book, held at Old Alabama Town, 301 Columbus St., in Montgomery. The festival offers workshops in fiction and nonfiction writing, poetry and setting up author tours. Also speaking at the event will be Dick Cooper, whose photographs of Muscle Shoals music in the 1970s offer the most comprehensive visual record of the scene.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-communication-fine-arts/departments/english/hall-waters-prize.html

About,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Life of Rosa Parks Montgomery Bus Boycott Dedication Ceremony Rosa Louise McCauley was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to James and Leona McCauley. At age two, her family moved to Pine Level, Alabama, to live with her maternal grandparents. Her mother, a school teacher, taught Rosa at home until age eleven when she moved to Montgomery to live with her aunt. She enrolled in a private school, the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls, where she cleaned classrooms to pay her tuition. Later she attended Booker T. Washington High School, but was forced to leave to take care of her sick mother. In 1932, she married Raymond Parks, to whom she would remain married until his death in 1977. Though Raymond had very little formal education, he was self-taught and supported his wife's desire to return to school. She received her high school diploma in 1934. Mrs. Parks worked as a seamstress at Montgomery Fair department store in 1955. On December 1 of that year, she boarded a city bus and sat on a row in the middle section where black customers were allowed to sit. The whites only section in the front of the bus filled up and a white man was left standing. The bus driver demanded that Mrs. Parks and three other patrons in the middle section give up their seats so the white man could sit. The other three people moved, but Mrs. Parks had been pushed around enough and refused to yield her seat. She was arrested when the bus driver contacted the police and filed charges against her. Four days later she was found guilty of disorderly conduct and the Montgomery Bus Boycott began. Over a year later, the city was served with papers declaring segregation of bus service unconstitutional. The next day, Mrs. Parks boarded a bus and for the first time was allowed to sit in any unoccupied seat. Her ordeal, however, was not over. She had lost her seamstress job and was unable to find work. Her family was harassed and threatened. In 1957, she moved (along with her mother and husband) to Detroit, where her younger brother Sylvester lived. In 1965, she joined the staff of U.S. Representative John Conyers of Michigan and worked there until her retirement in 1988. Mrs. Parks traveled the country extensively lecturing on civil rights. Through the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, a non-profit organization she co-founded with Elaine Steele in 1987, she worked with young people to help them achieve their full potential. She has received honorary degrees from nearly a dozen colleges and universities and has received countless honors and awards. On April 22, 1998, she attended the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Troy University Rosa Parks Library and Museum to be located on the spot where she was arrested. On December 1, 2000, she returned to Montgomery to participate in the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, dedicated in her honor. Mrs. Parks and her family were the first to tour the new library and museum. On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a public bus. In response, the Women's Political Council distributed fliers throughout the community urging African Americans to boycott the bus line on the day of Mrs. Parks's trial. The following Monday, Mrs. Parks was found guilty of disorderly conduct and fined. That afternoon, a meeting was held at Mt. Zion A.M.E. Zion Church and the Montgomery Improvement Association was formed. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was selected as the new organization's president. That evening, a meeting was held at the Holt Street Baptist Church. The attendees decided that continuing the bus boycott would be an effective way to protest the segregated bus service. In terms of participation, the bus boycott was an immediate success. Virtually all of the African Americans who formerly patronized the bus service now walked, arranged carpools, or found other means of transportation. Despite the strong participation in the boycott and the financial hardship experienced by the bus company, the laws were not changed. The Montgomery Improvement Association filed suit in federal court on behalf of those discriminated against by the bus service. On June 2, 1956, a federal court ruled for the Montgomery Improvement Association and declared segregated bus service to be unconstitutional. The ruling was appealed to the United States Supreme Court which, on November 13, 1956, upheld the lower court's findings. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956—382 days after Mrs. Parks's conviction when the court order requiring integrated bus service was served to Montgomery officials. December 1, 2000, Montgomery, AL Rosa Parks, the ""Mother of the Civil Rights Movement"" was the guest of honor when Troy University dedicated its new library and museum. The library will carry Mrs. Parks' name and commemorates her refusal to give up her seat up on the Montgomery City Bus to a white man. The incident occurred on December 1, 1955, at the site where the library is constructed and the museum depicts the event and the ensuing activities in the 382-day Montgomery Bus Boycott. ""Troy University, Montgomery Campus seized the opportunity of preserving the memory of courageous acts and courageous people, while using the property to best meet the needs of our students,"" Dr. Cameron Martindale said. The structure is a three-story, 55,000 square-foot state-of-the-art library to more than 3,100 non-traditional urban Troy University, Montgomery Campus students and the citizens of Montgomery and a museum and research center for those who will strive to understand the event that began the famous Bus Boycott. Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor of The Troy State University System, stated: ""I am very proud that Troy State University decided to undertake the creation of this unique museum. The Rosa Parks Library and Museum is an important part in the continued revitalization of downtown Montgomery, and it also serves both the community and the state as a focal point in our nation's history."" The ceremony began at 1 p.m. in the Davis Theatre for the Performing Arts, 231 Montgomery Street, Montgomery, Alabama, on the Troy University, Montgomery Campus, honoring Mrs. Parks on the 45th anniversary of her arrest. The dedication ceremony included remarks from Mrs. Rosa Parks, Ms. Elaine Steele, TROY Chancellor Jack Hawkins, Jr., and Troy University, Montgomery Campus President Cameron Martindale. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and Montgomery Mayor Bobby Bright also spoke. A tribute from the Women of the Movement was given to include Dr. Juanita Abernathy, Dr. Johnnie Mae Carr, Dr. Dorothy Height, Dr. Coretta Scott King, and Dr. Mamie Till-Mobley, and other dignitaries. There were other special presentations by Larry Long with the Youth of Rural Alabama, the Pathways to Freedom Youth, and the Troy State University Symphony Band and Gospel Choir. The opening tour of the museum was at 5 p.m. Other events of the day included lectures at 9:30 a.m. by Dr. Douglas Brinkley, author of ""Rosa Parks"", and at 10:30 a.m. by Vernon Jarrett, veteran journalist and historian, in the auditorium of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. Also, an exhibition of Yvonne Wells' colorful, narrative quilts depicting the Civil Rights Movement was on display at the museum. A Parade of Choirs entertained outside the Troy University Montgomery Campus before the program begins in the Davis Theatre. The museum contains an Erik Blome sculpture of Rosa Parks on the bus bench and portraits and sculpture of Rosa Parks by Los Angeles artist Artis Lane. The museum exhibits were designed and created by Eisterhold and Associates, Inc. The building design was by Sherlock, Smith and Adams.

Fall 2020,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Exciting things are always happening in the School of Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism Management. Whether that is a new event or a study abroad trip we are always evolving. We are immensely proud to have transitioned into the Sorrell College of Business this semester. Dr. Judson C. Edwards, Dean of the Sorrell College of Business, expresses his enthusiasm for the transition. “I am extremely happy to have the School of Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism Management (HSTM) relocate to the Sorrell College of Business at Troy University (Sorrell College). In my opinion, it offers several advantages in the short and long term for the Sorrell College and HSTM. First, it immediately provides a doctoral degree to our inventory of programs, which was not available in the Sorrell College before the relocation of HSTM. Second, there is a much closer relationship to the traditional business disciplines taught in the Sorrell College, such as marketing, economics, and management, to the HSTM course content and curriculum than disciplines housed in their former home, the College of Health and Human Services. Over time, I see the faculty within these business disciplines and HSTM faculty working more closely together to support one another both in terms of teaching and research. Finally, we are adding high-quality faculty and staff, hundreds of current students, and thousands of alumni in HSTM to the Sorrell College. Specifically to faculty additions, I am very pleased as to the teaching and research excellence demonstrated by HSTM faculty and falls directly in line or even exceeds our current high expectations of performance. Over time, I have no doubt this move will prove very successful and will raise the quality of all of our programs, which will graduate better prepared students and further enhance our academic reputation of the Sorrell College, both domestically and internationally.” Matthew Pisarski is a first-year graduate student obtaining a Master of Sport Management. He graduated from Troy University with a Bachelor of Science in Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism Management and a minor in Recreation Management. Matthew chose to come to Troy University from Bowling Green, Ohio. He quickly became incredibly involved by being a member of Circle K where he held offices as the treasurer and president and a member of the Sport Management Club where he was president his senior year. Matthew also served on the planning committee for the Spring 2019 Senior Summit and the Christmas party. His dedication to his studies awarded him Sigma Alpha Phi National Honor Society and Omicron Delta Kappa National Honor Society. Matthew started graduate school on a Graduate Assistantship for facilities and aquatics for campus recreation and in his 3rd, semester achieved the position of Facilities and Aquatics Coordinator. We would like to congratulate Matthew on his recent job offer. How has your education and coursework in the HSTM program helped prepare you for your career? “The education and coursework in the HSTM program helped prepare me for my career by offering a very wide number of projects that correlates with the current happenings in the industry. The different presentations in each class have helped me better myself as a presenter and boosted my confidence in talking in front of large groups. The coursework in the different classes was not all geared towards one specific occupation, the professor did a great job of making sure the students were prepared with the information that they need to start a career. I chose recreation as my minor and the classes offered for it helped get me to the position I am in now. Each class that the School of HSTM offers I have used in my career. That ranges from the hospitality classes that hit on customer service to the sport classes that help shape the toolbox that I am using today. The senior seminar class was the most helpful class that I took at Troy because everything that you learned through the years at Troy you had to put together and create a business that had to be successful on paper.” Camryn is a Senior, Hospitality Management Major with a minor in Event Management from Panama City, Florida.

Through that she assisted disabled people with their mobility needs and well-being, engaged in community events to increase awareness, performed housekeeping duties, and helped transfer patients. She has spent her summer breaks from Troy as a team leader and organizer for a children's camp. Her responsibilities were to ensure the overall coordination and quality of the program and plan and lead both the indoor and outdoor activities. Edita will soon be starting her internship working with The Greenbrier in West Virginia. We look forward to seeing all Edita accomplishes in her senior year at Troy. The School of Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism has made many events possible this semester. The first event was a Yoga class put on by the Festivals and Special Events Class. The mission of the event was to promote student health, increase involvement, and support local businesses. Troy University students were able to find rest by participating in the yoga session from their own home through Microsoft Teams. The event was led by Jessica Phillips, a yoga instructor at Neighborhood Barre. The class that hosted the event wanted to thank everyone who participated by giving $200 to the sorority with the highest attendance and two $25 gift cards through a raffle. The Namaste In Bed Yoga session had a great turnout. The Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism Webinar was another successful event put on under the supervision of Dr. Green and his committee from his Graduate Revenue Generation class. The webinar took place over 2 days and included 12 guest speakers from the hospitality, sport, and tourism field. The goal of this event was for HSTM undergraduate students to make connections and learn from professionals in their area of interest. We would like to thank all the students that participated and our guest speakers for their time. T-Roy's Table was a fun event put on by The Event Management and Operations Class. This event was to highlight a few local and out of town chefs and their favorite dishes to prepare. It also featured how to make a specialty fall cocktail. The chefs included Tanner, a Troy University Student, who showed us how to make an Apple Cider Cocktail, Dr. Dixon, the Director of the School of Hospitality, Sport, and Tourism Management, prepared a delicious sweet potato side dish, Chef Eric Huvar prepared a Cajun Butter Roasted Turkey, and Josie Boyd, a Troy University Alumni, baked Dairy-Free Pumpkin Muffins. T-Roy's Table was posted live on the HSTM Facebook and Instagram for all to enjoy with interactive trivia questions. The first to answer the trivia questions won a prize. Three prizes were awarded to Anna Cobb, Madalyn, and Jack Ryan. Thank you to everyone that helped make this event a huge success. Each semester, the HSTM Summit is held to allow our senior students the opportunity to present their business plan projects. Their audience includes a panel of judges and their family and friends. This fall, there were four group presentations given. For this assignment, the students work persistently throughout the semester with HSTM faculty and business consultants to develop a business plan with components focusing on facilities, finances, and marketing. To conclude their presentation, they give an overall sales pitch asking the ""investors"" for support of their business based on the information they have presented. The floor is then opened for a Q&A session to make sure the teams are well prepared and understand their business plan fully. The creative business plans this semester included Pins and Pints, D&F Golf Center, Flat Rock Adventure Park, and Big Time Brews. This is always a major event for the School of HSTM as all students are expected to attend, learn, and participate. The Event Planning and Operations class also is tasked with planning and setting up for the event. Congratulations to all the students who completed this class and are preparing for graduation. We are always proud and extremely impressed with HSTM students' projects. In the Fall 2019 semester, the HSTM faculty and staff celebrated Thanksgiving at their first ever Thanksgiving party. The school of HSTM enjoyed a huge Thanksgiving feast brought by everyone that attended. They also played trivia and sang karaoke. The event was a fun time to take a break from the semester and celebrate the holiday. The HSTM Christmas Party was also a new event that took place in the Fall 2019 semester. All HSTM students and faculty were invited to attend the party. They celebrated the ending to a great semester with many fun activities that included playing Kahoot, dirty Santa, decorating gingerbread houses, a photo booth, and singing karaoke. The students and faculty also participated in a food competition won by David Sims, enjoyed a hot chocolate bar, and presented senior seminar awards. This event was held on the 4th floor of stadium towers that was decked out in Christmas decorations.

Ella mostly coordinates wedding receptions, cocktail parties, and offsite catering. She looks forward to the next few months as Mardi Gras is approaching and her venue has a few balls booked. How has your education and coursework in the HSTM program helped prepare you for your future career path? “The most beneficial thing that the HSTM program does differently would be having more projects than just tests. I feel way more prepared for real life scenarios because of that. Also being required to work in the community. I think it holds us to a higher standard when your coursework is taken outside of just the classroom. I think we as HSTM students are more comfortable talking with professionals due to the exposure we've had with community service, senior seminar, doing interview projects, etc.” Cameron Christopher (2019): Get Engaged Media - Account ManagerAtlanta, GA Peyton Loyless (2019): City of Douglasville - Tourism Program CoordinatorDouglasville, GA Matthew Powers (2019): Fayette County Parks and Rec - Athletic CoordinatorFayette County, GA Percy Richards, Jr. (2019): Troy Athletics Ticket Office - Graduate Assistant of DevelopmentTroy, AL Michael Stopak (2019): Nantahala Outdoor Center - Guest Service LeadBryson City, NC Jacob Williams (2019): Montgomery Biscuits - Group Sales AssociateMontgomery, AL If you are an HSTM graduate, please let us know of your career updates by emailing hstm@troy.edu.

Supporting Your Student While Letting Them Go,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The college years can be exciting and stressful for both you and your child. They are exciting because your child will be learning to live independently and this allows both of you to explore other parts of your lives. They are stressful because this means that your relationship will change. Some find this process enjoyable; others do not. In order for this transition to be as productive as possible, you will need to be patient, understanding, supportive, and clear and reasonable about your expectations. Listed below are some tips you might find helpful during this process. Tip #1: Don't ask them if they are homesick. While it is true that many students miss being at home, most are so busy in the first weeks of school that they do just fine, as long as nothing reminds them about being away from home. Even if they never bring it up, you can rest assured that they do miss you. If your student is really homesick, encourage them to stick it out for one semester. Tip #2: Write, even if they don't write back. Your student will be exploring and enjoying their independence and this is necessary for their development. Even so, they want to keep family ties and the security that brings. It's nice for them to have things in the mailbox and depressing when it is empty. Still, they may not respond for some time. Don't interpret their silence as rejection. Tip #3: Ask questions (but not too many). First-year students tend to resent interference with their newfound lifestyle, but most want to know that someone is still interested in them. Parental curiosity can be experienced as supportive or alienating depending on the attitudes of the person involved. Honest inquiries that further the parent bond are welcomed. ""Pulling rank"", ""I have a right to know"" questions, and hidden agendas should be avoided. Tip #4: Expect change (but not too much). It is natural and inevitable that your student will change over the course of their time here. For some, this change is gradual. For others it is quick and dramatic. This can be quite stressful for all involved. It helps to remember that young adults should be forming their own identities, and that it is counterproductive to try and stop them from doing so. While you may never understand the changes in their social, vocational, and personal choices that may occur in college, it is within your power to accept them. Maturation can be a slow and painful learning process. Please be patient. Tip #5: Don't worry excessively about moody behavior. You might find parenting during the college years to be pretty thankless. Your student may sometimes feel overwhelmed with all that is happening, and they might turn to you in distress. But, you may rarely hear from them when things are going well. You are serving as a ""touchstone"" for your student, someone they can turn to when they feel the need. Regardless of what they might say, this is very valuable to them. If your student's ""bad mood"" seems persistent and you have concerns about it, call the staff at the Counseling Center to discuss it further. Tip #6: Visit (but not too often). Whether they admit it or not, students usually appreciate a visit from their parents. This gives them a chance to connect to both of their ""worlds"" at once. ""Surprise"" visits are usually not appreciated because they can feel disrespectful. It is better to wait for planned visits, such as the Family Weekend opportunity. Tip #7: Avoid the ""These are the best years of your life"" speech. The college years are full of discovery, inspiration, good times and friends. But they are also marked by indecision, insecurity, disappointment, and mistakes. In all probability your student will learn that college is much more challenging, in every way, than they imagined. Parents who think that college students ""have it made” and that they should always perform well and be worry-free are mistaken. Those that accept the highs and lows are providing the kind of support students need most. Tip #8: Communicate your expectations and stay informed. It is entirely appropriate for you to expect reasonable outcomes for your investment. Attendance, decent grades, safe and healthy choices, and signs of increasing responsibility should be evident to you. Negotiate and discuss these with your student, then look for that evidence. If you don’t find it, increase your level of supervision. Tip #9: Trust them. Finding oneself is a difficult enough process without feeling like the people whose opinions you respect most are second-guessing your own second-guessing. One mother wrote her son during his senior year: ""I love you and want for you all the things that make you happiest; and I guess you, not I, are the one who knows best what those things are."" If you're smart you'll believe it, mean it, and say it now. *Adapted from the National Orientation Director's Association at the University of Alabama Monday – Friday8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.*Office hours are subject to change based on holidays designated in the Troy University academic calendar.

More stringent approval levels may be implemented during certain budget situations. Approved: Cabinet, February, 2018OPR: SVC, Finance and Business Affairs Troy University Contractual, Financial, and Personnel Authority Level Implied in the authority levels set forth in this document is the understanding that appropriate personnel at the subunit levels have reviewed and provided appropriate input on these approvals. Grants and contracts are awarded to the University by federal and state agencies, corporations, and foundations. Departments with project oversight are responsible for the administration of sponsored program activities in compliance with all state and sponsor imposed guidelines and restrictions. Financial reporting for sponsored programs rests with Sponsored Program Accounting. Invoicing on sponsored programs are submitted by Sponsored Program Accounting to Principal Investigator for approval before the invoice is sent to the sponsor. Sponsored Program Accounting Sponsored Program Accounting (SPA) focuses on the financial administration of awards made to Troy University. Sponsored Program Accounting becomes involved when the sponsored agreement is fully executed and forwarded from Office of Sponsored Programs after acceptance but before expenditures are made. SPA remains involved until the sponsored agreement is considered financially closed. Sponsored Program Accounting is also responsible for documentation of cost sharing and preparation of the facilities and administrative cost rate study. Cost Sharing Granting agencies may require the University to bear some of the costs of a sponsored project, with a third party sometimes providing support. Per 2 CFR §200.29: Cost sharing or matching means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). Any cost sharing commitment must be approved by the department head, dean or director, and the appropriate Senior Vice Chancellor. Generally, funds from the granting agency and cost sharing funds should be spent at about the same rate throughout the project: for example, when 10% of grant funds have been spent, 10% of cost sharing funds should have also been spent. This provides even support by both parties throughout the project and prevents some problems at the end of the project. Granting agencies may accept several methods for cost sharing. It is important that both the method and the amount of cost sharing are clearly stated in the written agreement. Indirect Costs If indirect costs are the approved method for University cost sharing, the indirect costs are forfeited, meaning that the University gives up the right to be paid by the sponsoring agency for these indirect costs. No special account or certification is needed for this method of cost sharing. If a cost sharing report is required, Sponsored Program Accounting will compute the forfeited indirect costs and prepare the report. Fixed-Price Contracts Per 2 CFR §200.45: Fixed amount awards mean a type of grant agreement under which the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity provides a specific level of support without regard to actual costs incurred under the Federal award. This type of Federal award reduces some of the administrative burden and record-keeping requirements for both the non-Federal entity and Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. Accountability is based primarily on performance and results. A fixed-price contract is not adjusted when it actually costs more or costs less to complete the project than the price initially agreed upon. It is very important that all fixed-price contracts be clearly identified as such in the written agreement. All projects costs, including indirect costs, are to be charged to the contract/grant account. Indirect costs, at Federally-approved rates, should be included in the proposal or contract budget and subsequently charged to the account. In some cases, funds may remain in an account after a fixed-price project has been completed, all bills have been paid, and all payments have been received from the sponsor. If the University's policies regarding project costs and indirect cost recovery have been met, the University may allow the administering department to use the remaining funds. Policy to Facilitate Final Billing and Reporting for Contracts and Grants Sponsored Program Accounting is responsible for the preparation and submission of invoices and financial reports to the agencies that provide funding for sponsored projects. These financial documents are prepared based on information in the University's accounting records and on special requirements of the sponsors. After the expiration date of a sponsored project, the University has a specified number of days to submit the final invoice or final financial report. A late submission could result in a loss of funds to the University. The deadline for final reporting on Federal grants normally is 90 days from expiration. For contracts (Federal or non-Federal) the specific deadline for final financial reporting is given in the agreement; common deadlines are 30 days, 45 days, 60 days, or 90 days from expiration. The deadlines for cost share accounts are the same as for the sponsored accounts. In order to comply with sponsors' financial reporting deadlines in an orderly and efficient manner, recipient departments should pay all bills promptly, particularly near the end of the project. The financial manager in each department should be aware of the expiration dates and deadlines for each sponsored project in the department and should make any needed adjustments in a timely manner. If any orders are placed near the end of the project, the department should notify the vendor of the deadlines involved to ensure delivery of the products and receipt of the invoice within the time available. (Normally, all products should be delivered while the sponsored project is still in process; otherwise, the costs could be disallowed since they were not received in time to benefit the project.) If salaries and wages are being charged to the contract/grant account, the departments should ensure that steps are taken to reassign employee salaries and wages to other accounts, as appropriate, when the project is over. Under this policy, Sponsored Program Accounting is authorized to submit final invoices and financial reports based on the project deadlines provided by the sponsor. It is, therefore, critical that the recipient departments pay all project costs within these deadlines to ensure that the University is reimbursed for all allowable project costs. Please note that unreimbursed project costs must be covered by the college/school/department involved. Policy on Allowable Cost for Grants and Contracts This document provides guidance on appropriate budgeting and expenditures of sponsored funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources and whether directed toward research, training, or other purposes. All federal awards issued after December 26, 2014 must comply with OMB CFR 200 Uniform Guidance, the basis for this document. Most awards issued before that date must comply with OMB Circular A21 (unless the agency has notified TROY of adoption of the new guidelines). There are a limited number of areas where the Uniform Guidance differs from previous federal regulations, specifically OMB Circular A-21. These include, but are not limited to, administrative and clerical expenses, direct charges of computing devices, visa costs for recruiting purposes, and expenses relating to fluctuations in exchange rates. All Principal Investigators and administrators at Troy University within all schools, units, divisions, University-wide initiatives, and centers who are responsible for budgeting and expenditures charged to sponsored awards must comply with these guidelines. This guidance is based on the interpretation of federal regulations, and adherence is required for all sponsored awards. For any costs to be charged directly to a federal award the expense must be: An expense is a “direct cost” if that expense can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project or other activity with a high degree of accuracy. “Indirect costs” (sometimes referred to as facilities and administrative (F&A) costs or overhead), are costs that benefit many activities (e.g., building operations and maintenance, IT expenses, security, administrative personnel such as grant managers, etc.). F&A costs are recovered through the federally negotiated rate. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as either direct expenses or indirect costs. This section provides guidance for some of the more common types of costs associated with federal research expenditures. Refer to the Cost Principles in Subpart E, §200.400-200.475 of the Uniform Guidance for the full listing of types of costs. Please contact your Sponsored Program Accountant with any specific questions. In general, there are three categories of expenses: Definition: Administrative and clerical personnel provide non-technical support services that benefit departmental, institute, center, or school activities. The services of these individuals could include: clerical support, financial management, procurement of materials and services, budget and planning, and personnel management. The salaries of administrative and clerical personnel are normally treated as an indirect cost unless they meet the definition of “unlike purpose and circumstance” and are integral to the project. As stipulated in the Uniform Guidance, direct charging of administrative salaries is allowable when all of the following 4 conditions are met: Definition: The costs of advertising media, including magazines, newspapers, radio and television, direct mail, exhibits, electronic or computer transmittals, and related administrative expenses. Advertising/media expenses are only allowable as a direct charge if used solely for one of the following uses: Alcoholic beverages and related expenses are unallowable costs and can only be charged to a federal award if alcohol is specifically necessary for the aim and scope of the project and the agency has provided specific approval in the award notice or if they are approved in writing by the sponsor. Bad debt or uncollected billings, including losses (whether actual or estimated) from uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable and may not be charged to a federal award. Collections and legal expenses related to bad debt are also unallowable. Compensation costs are generally allowable as a direct expense when the paid effort provides a direct benefit to the award and when the amount is within the federally allowable limits (e.g., agency-specific salary caps). Special Considerations: Definition: Severance pay is compensation in addition to regular salary and wages paid by an institution to employees whose services are being terminated. Expenses of severance pay are allowable only to the extent that such payments are required by law, or by TROY-employee agreement, AND availability of funds in Sponsored award. Communication Expenses (cell phones, internet) 2 CFR 200 Appendix II Due to the difficulty in identifying portions of a communications bill to a specific award or other university activity with a high degree of accuracy and certainty, communication expenses are generally included in the indirect cost calculations and treated as indirect costs. Only when a communication expense meets the “unlike purpose and circumstances” criteria can they be directly charged to a sponsored award. Communication expenses charged as indirect costs include the following: What communication costs can be charged as a direct expense? Communication expenses that can be linked to a specific sponsored project with a high degree of accuracy and are used primarily for the sponsored project may be charged as a direct expense. Examples of communication expenses that may be charged as a direct cost include the following: Equipment, including fabrications, with a total acquisition cost of $5,000 or greater is considered capital equipment and may only be charged as a direct expense when it is necessary for the performance of the sponsored award. Special purpose equipment” is equipment that is used only for research, medical, scientific, or other technical activities. Examples of special purpose equipment include microscopes, genomic sequencers, imaging equipment, and spectrometers. General purpose equipment” is equipment which is not limited to research, medical, scientific or other technical activities. Examples include office equipment and furnishings, telephone networks, information technology equipment and systems, air conditioning equipment, and reproduction and printing equipment. General purpose equipment is generally treated as an indirect cost because it cannot be easily linked to a particular cost objective. Equipment types that are typically considered “general purpose” may only be appropriate as a direct expense when the PI is able to justify that the equipment is necessary for the unique scientific/technical tasks of the specific agreement, not already available, and will be initially utilized almost exclusively for the award objectives. Routine repair and maintenance of general purpose equipment are normally treated as indirect costs. Service, repairs or warrantee costs for special purpose equipment dedicated to a sponsored project may be charged directly. Equipment purchases charged directly to an award must be necessary for performance on the project; therefore, equipment purchases near the end of an award period should have additional scrutiny and may be subject to project-specific justification and/or sponsor approval. Expense increases for fluctuations in exchange rates can be treated as a direct expense when existing funding is available to cover the difference and there is prior approval by the awarding agency. Expenses resulting from violations (or alleged violations) of, or failure to comply with, federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations are unallowable. Examples of items that may not be charged to a federal award include: In very rare situations, if the expense is incurred as the result of complying with a specific provision of the federal award or with prior written approval from the federal awarding agency, the expense may be directly charged to the award. General purpose materials and supplies purchased and used by departments for all activities should not be directly charged to sponsored awards. Examples include copy paper, office supplies, and cleaning materials. Items purchased specifically for one or more research projects may be charged as direct expenses. If the use of the items is shared among projects or labs, an allocation methodology should be created, documented and periodically reviewed. Examples of office supplies that may be charged as a direct expense include: Books, journals, periodicals, and subscriptions are normally treated as indirect costs. Examples of unallowable charges: These expenditures may be charged as direct expenses only in unusual circumstances. Examples include: Definition: Machines used to acquire, store, analyze, process, and publish data and other information electronically, including accessories (or “peripherals”) for printing, transmitting, and receiving or storing electronic information. Computing devices that cost less than $5,000, and are essential and allocable to the performance of an award, may be charged directly either as a purchase or a lease. Examples of computers that can be charged as direct expenses include: A computer that will remain property of the University (and not the personal property of an individual) Computing devices may be allocated to multiple sponsored awards if the project's portion of the use can be reasonably estimated and is directed by the PI. The expense should be properly allocated to all benefitting activities. If a device will be used only in part for an award's activities, the award may only be charged for a portion of the device's expense. University-funded activities such as instruction and administration should bear at least their fair share of the acquisition expense. De Minimis use of the device for other activities is allowed as long as the device is using the device primarily on the sponsored project(s). Copier charges for general administrative support of a project should not be charged as a direct expense. Copy charges may only be an appropriate direct charge in cases when both of the following criteria are met: Dues and memberships in professional organizations are normally charged as indirect costs because their purpose is more general in nature – i.e., furthering a PI's knowledge in his/her field – and cannot be identified with a high degree of specificity to an individual research project. Membership may be charged only if it is required for conference attendance where the researcher is presenting his or her research or obtaining, circulating, or distributing information to advance the performance of the project. Note: the membership fee is allowable as a direct cost to the project if it reduces the overall cost of attending the conference. Definition: Direct expenses for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences or training projects. Participant support costs are allowed if all of the following criteria are met: Note: NIH will only allow Participant support costs to be charged if they were approved in the original Funding Opportunity Announcement. A participant is defined as a non-TROY employee who is the recipient, not the provider, of a training associated with a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium, or other short-term instructional or information sharing activity. Participants are not required to provide any deliverable to the university and they are not subject to Troy University human resources policies (e.g., they cannot be terminated for failure to perform). Participants may include students, scholars, and scientists from other institutions, representatives of private sector companies, teachers, and state or local government agency personnel. A person classified as an intern would be paid as an employee and not as a participant, because the intern, while receiving certain training, is also providing services. What expenses can be included in participant support costs? Participant support costs include expenditures for items such as the following: What expenses CANNOT be included as participant support costs? Participant support costs do not include the following types of payments: Per 200.308(c)(5), prior approval is required to transfer funds budgeted for participant support costs to other categories of expenses. Postage or express mailing expenses are generally treated as indirect costs. If the expenses are required for a project and can be linked to that specific project, the cost may be charged as a direct expense. Examples of shipping and postage expenses that may be charged as direct costs: Costs of professional and consultant services are allowable as direct expenses when all of the following conditions are met: All TROY employees must be budgeted as salary and cannot be included as consultants, advisors or vendors. Retainer fees for professional services must be supported by evidence of bona fide services available or rendered. Any professional service costs related to defense and prosecution in criminal and civil proceedings are unallowable. See the University Travel Policy and Fly America Act. Travel-related expenses are allowable as direct expenses when they provide a direct benefit to the sponsored award. Unallowable travel expenses include: Domestic and foreign travel charged to a sponsored project must follow these guidelines as well as the Troy University Travel Policy and funding agency requirements, whichever imposes the greater restrictions. Travel expenses that directly support the sponsored project may be charged on an actual expense basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual expenses incurred, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip. Policy on Personnel Cost for Grants and Contracts The salaries and wages of university employees and related staff benefits required to complete a sponsored project (including but not limited to Principal Investigator's academic and summer salary, postdoctoral research associates, technicians and graduate students) should be budgeted, charged and reported as a direct cost under this category of expenditure. Salaries and wages include holiday, vacation, and sick pay as appropriate. Expenses used in computing fringe benefits are: (a) Social Security; (b) Teacher's Retirement; and (c) Group Life, Long Term Disability and Medical Insurance. As a rule, administrative and clerical salaries are treated as indirect costs, except as outlined in the following guidelines. These are considered Office of Management and Budget (OMB) exceptions. A non-exhaustive list of administrative and clerical positions includes fiscal officers, accountants, secretaries, directors, vice presidents, president, office personnel, executive assistants, and administrators. Salaries and fringe benefits of administrative and clerical staff may be charged as direct costs in instances where sponsored projects require the services of administrative and clerical staff beyond the normal level provided by departmental administrators paid from a “University” account. The total cost of these services may be budgeted, charged, and reported as a direct cost to a sponsored project when all of the following conditions apply: It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) or Project Director to support and justify in the proposal all direct costs to be charged to a sponsored award. The office of Sponsored Program Accounting will approve direct costs that meet Cost Accounting Standards exceptions guidelines. As a recipient of federal funding Troy University is required to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (“Uniform Guidance”) as well as other federal requirements for certifying effort expended on sponsored awards. TROY requires all individuals who receive sponsored funding to comply with University policies and sponsoring agency regulations regarding the proposing, charging, and reporting of effort on those awards. University faculty and staff are expected to charge their time to sponsored awards commensurate with the committed effort expended on all activities they perform. Payroll charges to sponsored awards, and cost sharing recorded for faculty and staff, serve as the initial data points for the University's effort reporting system. The Uniform Guidance Subpart E §200.430 contains the federal regulatory requirements for internal controls over certifying time expended on sponsored projects. The University's practice is to utilize an after-the-fact effort reporting system to certify salaries charged, or cost shared to sponsored awards, are reasonable and consistent with the work performed. The individual's effort is first assigned to specific awards in the payroll system based on anticipated activities. Actual effort expended on each project is certified by a responsible person with suitable means of verification the work was performed, generally the principal investigator, at the end of specified reporting periods. The effort certification should be a reasonable estimate of how time was expended. Section §200.430(c) states, “It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. When recording salaries and wages charged to Federal awards for IHEs [Institutions of Higher Education] a precise assessment of factors that contribute to costs is therefore not always feasible, nor is it expected.” The Monthly Effort Reporting Forms are the means for complying with the federal regulations relating to effort certification. All individuals who either receive payment or whose salary/or portion is used as matching on a sponsored award must comply with this policy. Adherence to this policy is required for all effort related to federally sponsored awards as well as any non-federal awards. The Effort report must contain all activities for which compensation is paid by Troy University. The total work effort should equal 100%. The certifier is expected to review the percentages on the effort report and verify whether they reasonably reflect the individual's effort. Salary distribution consistent with effort percentages will be done in the Sponsored Program Accounting office based on the information provided on the Effort Report. It is each PI's responsibility to ensure the salary distributions are done correctly and in a timely manner. Policy on Subrecipient Monitoring for Grants and Contracts Troy University is responsible for monitoring the programmatic and financial activities of its subrecipients to ensure proper stewardship of sponsor funds. The following policy applies to all subawards issued under sponsored programs, without regard to the primary source of funding. Additionally, this policy addresses institutional responsibilities and assists Principal Investigators (PIs) and administrators to ensure that, in addition to achieving performance goals, subrecipients comply with applicable federal laws and regulations and with the provisions of each subaward agreement. OMB Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200) (“Uniform Guidance”), specifically §200.331, requires pass-through entities to evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance in order to determine the appropriate monitoring level, monitor the activities of subrecipient organizations to ensure that the subaward is in compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and terms of the subaward, and verify that subrecipients are audited as required by Subpart F of the Uniform Guidance. For non-federal awards, Troy may also be required by the sponsor to provide evidence of due diligence in reviewing the ability of a subrecipient to properly meet the objectives of the subaward and account for the sponsor's funds. Failure to adequately monitor the compliance of subrecipients could result in reputational damage to the University and Schools, and jeopardize current and future funding. It is the responsibility of TROY, as the pass-through entity, to ensure the good stewardship of sponsored funding. All funds assigned to subrecipient organizations should receive the same diligence as sponsored funds that remain at Troy University. All Principal Investigators (PIs) and administrators at Troy University within all schools, units, divisions, University-wide initiatives, and centers, who are involved with the administration and conduct of sponsored awards that issue and manage subawards must comply with this policy. Subrecipient means the legal entity to which a subaward is made and which is accountable to the University for the use of the funds provided in carrying out a portion of the University's programmatic effort under a sponsored project. The term may include institutions of higher education, for-profit corporations, and foreign or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) at the discretion of the Federal awarding agency. Annual subrecipient monitoring includes those activities undertaken to review the financial status and management controls of a subrecipient to mitigate the risk of contracting with a subrecipient organization. Pre-award subrecipient review includes those activities undertaken prior to officially subcontracting with a third-party organization. Such activities may include reviewing organizational, financial or other information to identify potential risks. Post-award subrecipient monitoring refers to those day-to-day activities undertaken to monitor billings and scientific progress of an active subaward. A subaward is an award of financial support from a prime awardee to a qualified organization for the performance of a substantive portion of the program funded under the prime award. The term also includes awards made by a subrecipient to a lower-tier subrecipient. It does not include procurement of goods and services funded by a prime award (i.e., vendors are not considered subrecipients). PIs have primary responsibility for monitoring subrecipients to ensure the responsible stewardship of funds, including: Identifying the risk level of the subrecipient organizations. Sponsored Program Accounting is responsible for the oversight of TROY's subrecipient monitoring program and ensuring the procedures are compliant with federal and other applicable regulations. Consultants and professional services must be authorized according to authority levels defined in 701.4.ii prior to the engagement of such services. Authorized approvers must ensure the desired professional services are not available internally through other Troy departments and/or personnel, and funding is available within the department budget to cover the cost of these professional services. An Authorization to Provide Services form should be submitted to Human Resources to determine if the services performed are considered employee services or independent contractor/consultant services. Upon verification the services are being performed as an independent contractor/consultant, an Independent Contractor/Consultant Agreement must be completed as documentation of the service agreement. The dollar amount of the consulting agreement will dictate the level of required signatures. Consultants must also have a signed W-9 form on file in the Purchasing Department before they can be compensated. Troy University employees can neit",

800 - Technology,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University recognizes that the Web is an important electronic publication medium that facilitates its mission. It is in the interest of the University that all Web sites are maintained in a consistent manner so that they provide high quality information about the University's educational offerings, mission, programs and events to the community, prospective students, and the general public. The Web sites serve as a gateway to college services, teaching and learning resources. This policy sets minimal standards that are meant to ensure that information published electronically is visually appealing, well-written and follows the same high standards as other forms of published information. The World Wide Web is one of the primary ways in which TROY presents itself and communicates to various audiences. Therefore, it is essential that Web sites of the University present an image that is unified, of a high quality and favorably represents the University. The TROY Web Guide is intended to serve in this regard as a valuable resource for those who contribute in any way to the Web presence of Troy University. Please direct any questions or comments to members of the Web Team whose names are located on the last page of this Web Guide. Review of Policy TROY recognizes that electronic publication technology is evolving rapidly and this policy is expected to evolve along with it. The policy will be reviewed as needed by the Web Team and the Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communication. This policy does not address all servers, such as Spectrum or Prism servers, or faculty Web pages. Site Life Cycle Information on Web pages should be updated as regularly as necessary, whether that is daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. The date the page was last updated should be indicated somewhere on the page. If a page does not need to be updated more than once a year, the “this page is updated” should be changed at least every six months to let visitors know that the information is relatively accurate. Every office is encouraged to update or refresh the content and design of their pages twice a year, preferably every fall and spring or more frequently if needed. As new templates are developed, they will be available on the Troy University Web site. Design Quality Graphic design is the first and last part of the site observed by online visitors. Effectively designed Web sites grab viewer attention and offer clear, consistent navigation. The Web team will provide templates to help design sites that are consistent with the look and feel of the University's homepage and interior pages. Templates may be viewed on the Troy University Web site. Content Quality For recommended style standards, refer to the TROY Style and Graphic Standards Manual. For Web-related words, keep in mind the following: homepage is one word, Web is uppercase when it stands alone; lowercase when combined with another word (e.g. Web site; World Wide Web; webmaster), download and upload are spelled as one word and online is one word, no hyphen. Use of University Marks and Branding TROY logos and word marks may be used on official University Web sites such as University departments, approved student groups and schools, as long as the logos are used correctly. For correct logo usage, consult the TROY Style and Graphic Standards Manual (Marketing). Navigation A clear, easy navigation through every page of the TROY Web site is a necessity. A site and its pages should not be a maze where visitors must guess their next move or try the “Back” button to get out. Every page should, at a minimum, include (a) a link to the TROY homepage and (b) the homepage footer menu bar. Pages should also include a link to the appropriate department/division/school/etc. from where the page originates. URL links should be tested routinely to ensure that they are still correct. The TROY templates include navigation to frequently used sites within TROY and quick links to the University's interior pages. Templates Troy University requires Web pages to look consistent, including certain common design elements. To simplify this process, University-approved templates are available for use on the Troy University Web site. World Wide Web Guidelines This policy governs documents (Web pages) appearing on the World Wide Web from Troy University servers. Both official and unofficial University Web sites, as defined below, must comply with all copyright laws of the United States, all other applicable local, state and federal laws and applicable policies, rules and guidelines of Troy University, including those defined herein. The dominant theme of any Web site, whether an official or unofficial University Web site, must not appeal to prurient interest to the average person applying contemporary community standards. This policy will be periodically revised in response to pertinent legal and/or technological issues in consultation with the appropriate entities. Any questions, comments or suggestions concerning this policy should be addressed to the Troy University Web Team. Official University Web sites are defined as Web sites or Web pages created by Troy University entities including, but not limited to, its colleges, schools, departments and administrative offices stating they represent TROY. All official University Web sites must be approved by the Web coordinator who has administrative oversight over the area represented by the Web site or by the TROY Web team. The associate vice chancellor for marketing and communication will be the final approving authority for all official Web sites. All official University Web sites must adhere to the minimum standards described below. These minimum standards are presented in conjunction with associated recommendations in this Web Guide. Display clear identification of Troy University on the top-level pages of each Web site. The preferred means of identification is to display a Troy University word mark. The official TROY templates are required for University offices. Display a clearly labeled link on each Web page to the TROY homepage (https://www.troy.edu). Display clearly labeled ownership information on each Web page in the form of a contact e-mail address, which may be supplemented by a contact name and/or telephone number. In unusual cases, a contact name and telephone number may be substituted for a contact e-mail address. Display a clearly labeled disclaimer (example: http://www.troy.edu/disclaimer): “Although the authors of this Web site have made every reasonable effort to be factually accurate, no responsibility is assumed for editorial or clerical errors or error occasioned by honest mistake. All information contained on this Web site is subject to change by the appropriate officials of Troy University without prior notice. Material on this Web site does not serve as a contract between TROY and any other party.” The appropriate administrative unit(s) that publishes information on an official University Web site is fully responsible for factually accurate content and currency of information. Web sites that contain out-of-date information may be requested by the Web team or a member of that team to make necessary corrections. Web sites failing to comply following such requests may be unlinked from the University page until the necessary corrections have been made. All official University Web sites must present information using the highest editorial standards (spelling, punctuation, grammar, style, etc.). Web sites that contain editorial errors may be requested to make the necessary corrections by any member of the Web Team. Web sites failing to comply following such requests may be unlinked from the University page until the necessary corrections have been made. Any official University Web site desiring to conduct commercial activity, including receipt of online credit card payments, must take appropriate steps to ensure secured transactions. These type transactions must be approved by the Vice Chancellor for Finance prior to placing this type of information or capability on the University Web site. Links to commercial entities must be related to the University's mission and must not imply endorsement by the University. All names used to represent the University must be official names recognized by Troy University, e.g., “Troy University,” “TROY,” “TROY-Dothan campus,” etc. Except when referring to Troy University athletics, the use of Trojans” is discouraged. Unofficial University Web sites are defined as Web sites or Web pages created and maintained by anyone other than Troy University campuses, Web coordinators or site masters. All unofficial University Web sites must carry the following disclaimer: “The views, opinions and conclusions expressed in this page are those of the author or organization and not necessarily those of Troy University or its officers and trustees. The content of this page has not been reviewed or approved by Troy University and the author or organization is solely responsible for its content.” Troy University will not undertake to pre-approve or review the content of unofficial University Web sites. However, any pages discovered in violation of this policy are subject to immediate removal from Troy University Web servers. Unofficial University Web sites may not be used for commercial purposes or for personal financial gain or benefit. Troy University is not responsible for any liability resulting from any such activities prior to their discovery and appropriate remedy. Site Ownership The Web team will be coordinated by the Information Technology (IT) department of the university. Its responsibilities are assisting with the development of templates, approving templates and making them available to departments in the realm of the Web. Members of the Web Team will be responsible for assisting content providers and site masters and in monitoring the various sites to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the published information. In addition, the Web team will seek the advice of document and design experts when necessary. Administrative departments, academic units, individual faculty and staff, and student and college organizations may contribute content to the various Web sites. Content providers, in effect, own the content of a given page and are responsible for accuracy. Content providers should have firsthand knowledge of a particular page's content. Though they need not have specialized Web publishing knowledge, familiarity with Web-writing guidelines is very useful because text online is read differently than printed text and thus needs to be written differently. All pages should include the content provider's e-mail address on the bottom of the page, along with the date that the page was last updated so that interested readers can get in touch with the content expert. Other things content providers should remember in the design of Web sites include the following: Do nothing that might lead users of the TROY Web site into making improper use of our facilities, for example, providing links to: Every site must be owned and maintained by a staff or faculty member—not a student or external company. Using an external vendor to create, and in some instances to help maintain a site, is acceptable; however, at least one faculty or staff member from the responsible office must own and be accountable for the site, including having a basic knowledge of how to update, remove or change information on the site. Student interns may help create or update sites; however, a student cannot be the owner of the site and cannot be the only person in the responsible office who knows how to update and manipulate the site. Ownership by staff or faculty is essential in order to maintain continuity of a Web site. Student workers are a marvelous resource, but when the student leaves, the Web site still needs to be maintained, updated and even redesigned at some point in time. Without ownership by staff or faculty, material on the Web can easily become outdated. Outdated and inaccurate information on a Web site is often worse than no information at all. The individual Web coordinators for each site will oversee and maintain the registry of site owners. The information gathered for the registry is used to not only delete old or non-maintained sites, but also to quickly identify who is responsible for each existing University site. Each owner of a newly created site must register with the Web coordinator for his/her particular campus or site. This can be done online on the Troy University Web site. Every office, organization and school is responsible for the look and content presented on its site, as well as keeping the sited updated, fresh and consistent with the overall look of the Troy University homepage and interior pages. The Web team has overall oversight not only of the University's homepage and interior pages, but also of all pages on the TROY Web site. Every office, organization and school is responsible for the look and content of their site. When there are egregious errors or problems with a site, the Web team will contact the person responsible for the page and discuss ways to fix the problem. If the problem persists or if it is an emergency situation that requires immediate attention, the Web team maintains the right and responsibility to shut down a site either on a temporary or permanent basis. Working with an external Web design vendor is an acceptable solution when developing a University Web site or page. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, the following policies should be understood and shared when working with external vendors. All code and images belong to Troy University. The created Web site must reside on an approved Web server. Requested changes to the structure of existing Web areas, such as moving existing areas to new locations, removing existing areas or redirecting areas, will need to be approved by the Web coordinator at the campus where the changes are requested and by any other department heads whose departments may be affected by the requested changes. All tags should conform to the guidelines and recommendations given by the World Wide Web Consortium. The Consortium also offers a validation service for your pages. So if you wish to test them, just type your URL into the appropriate box. Always check your pages carefully, particularly if you have been using a word processor that translates text into html. When the text is translated, these programs often insert alien characters, such as accents and random letters, or shrink the text to an unreadable size. Such word processors include Microsoft Excel, SPSS Data Analysis Software, Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect, etc. Troy University uses information technology to help students, faculty, and staff accomplish their goals. Information technology also helps the Troy University reach its objectives. This worldwide reliance upon diverse technologies means increased responsibilities and opportunities for everyone throughout the University. The timely and appropriate use of these information technologies will help each person succeed.

TROY Protected Data Listed below are examples of types of personally identifiable information that are generally protected by local, state, or Federal privacy regulations. These examples are not an exhaustive list of all possible types of information that are protected by local, state, or Federal privacy regulations. Examples: FERPA is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. This law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA provides students with the right to inspect and review certain education records maintained by the school and to request corrections if the records are inaccurate or misleading. It requires that schools obtain written permission before releasing information from a student's education record. It also allows schools to publish certain “directory” information about students, unless the student has requested that the school not do so. The penalty for failing to comply with FERPA may result in the loss of all federal funding, including grants and financial aid. Additional FERPA information can be found on the U.S. Department of Education page and on the Troy University Web site. GLBA protects consumers' personal financial information held by financial institutions. It requires that financial institutions provide customers with a privacy notice explaining what information is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected. The penalty for failing to comply with GLBA is a fine of up to $100,000 for the institution and of up to $10,000 for the officers and directors of the institution. Additional GLBA information can be found on the Federal Trade Commission Web site. HIPAA protects the privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI). It establishes regulations for the use and disclosure of PHI, including a patient's health status, provision of health care, medical records or payment history. Penalties for wrongfully disclosing PHI range from a $50,000 to a $250,000 fine and a one year to a ten year prison term, depending on the circumstances. These fines are for the individual, not the institution. Additional HIPPA information can be found on the HHS.gov Web site. PCI DSS is an industry standard which protects credit card customer account data. It requires specific control objectives be met by any organization that accepts credit cards for payment. These control objectives include secure network, server, and desktop standards, as well as procedures to ensure that credit card data is properly protected during the transaction. Failing to comply with PCI DSS can result in significant fines. Credit card providers can fine merchants up to $500,000 per compromise when the merchant was not compliant at the time of the compromise. Merchants may also be banned from accepting certain types of credit cards. Additional information can be found on the PCI Website. If you work for TROY inside the United States but outside of Alabama or the United States, please send an email containing the state in which you work to security@troy.edu. The Information Security team will respond to you with any data privacy laws that also apply to you. June 4, 2009: Initial Policy (TROY IT Best practices)August 2, 2016: Policy Updated for reviewSeptember 7, 2016: Policy submitted for adoptionDecember 12, 2024: Policy Updated for review Encryption This policy covers all computers, electronic devices, and media capable of storing electronic data that house TROY Protected data or TROY Sensitive data as defined by the Data Classification Policy. This policy also covers the circumstances under which encryption must be used when data is being transferred. The purpose of this policy is to establish the types of devices and media that need to be encrypted, when encryption must be used, and the minimum standards of the software used for encryption. Encryption is required for all laptops, workstations, and portable drives that may be used to store or access TROY Protected data. Encryption is recommended for all laptops, workstations, and portable drives that may be used to store or access TROY Sensitive data. IT will provide, install, configure, and support encryption where it is needed. Departments who have a laptop, workstation, or portable drive that needs to be encrypted should contact the IT Information Security team at security@troy.edu. Any transfer of unencrypted TROY Protected data or TROY Sensitive data must take place via an encrypted channel. Encrypted TROY Protected data or TROY Sensitive data may be transmitted via encrypted or unencrypted channels. All email communications that involve email addresses outside of TROY use an unencrypted channel, and therefore require that messages containing Troy Protected data or TROY Sensitive data be encrypted. Approved methods of encrypting electronic data transfers are listed in the appendix. If the encryption method includes a password, that password must be transferred through an alternative method, such as calling the individual and leaving the password on their voice mail. Email messages containing encrypted data may never include the password in the same message as the encrypted data. Individuals who are unsure if they are correctly encrypting electronic data transfers should contact the IT Information Security team at security@troy.edu. Any time TROY Protected data or TROY Sensitive data is placed on a medium such as a CD, DVD, or portable drive to facilitate a physical transfer, either entirely within TROY or between TROY and a 3rd party, that data must be encrypted. Archiving TROY Protected data or TROY Sensitive data to a physical medium is not recommended, but is permitted if the data is encrypted. All archiving should be done electronically, so that it is stored in a controlled data center and backed up by IT. IT will install software that is capable of encrypting the entire hard drive on all identified TROY computers and electronic devices subject to this Policy. Users who require encryption software should contact IT to arrange installation of encryption software. If you have questions about this policy, please contact the Information Security team at security@troy.edu. Failure to follow this policy can result in disciplinary action as provided in the Staff Handbook, Student Handbook, and Faculty Handbook. Disciplinary action for not following this policy may include termination, as provided in the applicable handbook or employment guide. Examples of portable drives: IT will make the following approved encryption methods available for electronic data transfers All data transfers and the use of portable drives/devices must comply with the university's broader data security, privacy, and acceptable use policies. Staff and faculty are required to consult IT for guidance when dealing with highly sensitive or regulated data to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and institutional guidelines.

Civic Engagement,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Civic and community engagement is an integral part of every student's college experience. The Office of Civic Engagement provides students opportunities to make a difference in our local community while applying knowledge acquired in the classroom to develop skills in civic action and service. We aim to facilitate quality civic learning experiences that engage TROY students, faculty, and staff with community needs and enhance the academic experience. We believe relationships build community. We see Community Engagement as a collaborative relationship between higher education institutions and their neighbors. Through the Office of Civic Engagement, students work with community partners in education, nonprofit and business sectors to connect to real-world challenges, explore causes, understand needs and work to address public issues. Our goal is to build capacity and work alongside our neighbors to contribute to a strong and resilient community. While our campus and community initiatives are focused on addressing local needs, Civic Engagement offers a variety of opportunities for service and engagement. Students can volunteer with Civic Engagement programs based on their interest or availability. Our initiatives center around these public issues: Throughout the academic year, students can volunteer weekly as a civic scholar through one of our five core initiatives or attend a single event at any time during the semester as their schedule allows. Campus Kitchens is an umbrella for all of our programs aimed at addressing food insecurity in our community. Campus Kitchens captures and reclaims unused, excess food and directs meals to those in need in our local community. Each Thursday, excess food from the dining hall is donated and packaged; on Fridays, packaged food is delivered to youth-serving community agencies. Backpack for Kids provides backpacks filled with supplemental food for children in need. Food is typically donated by different initiatives or organizations. Civic Lab is a mentoring program hosted in partnership with Charles Henderson Middle School. This program seeks to bring deliberative discussion to middle school classrooms to focus on community inclusion. Civic Scholars participating in the mentoring program must are required to serve for at least one semester. During the academic school year, college students facilitate discussions and mentor students each semester. The Democracy Project is a campus engagement initiative which focuses on engaging college students through a variety of platforms. These engagement platforms include discussions, film, social media, and opinion polls. The Community Gardens Program focuses on educating seniors and youth on nutrition education. Civic Engagement has placed several gardens around the city of Troy that generate fresh fruits and vegetables for local children and seniors. This year, gardens at Troy Elementary will be the focus of the Community Gardens Program. Bright Futures is a new community partnership through the Office of Civic Engagement that will work increase capacity with a local high school to assist students with college access. Civic Scholars will visit the high school biweekly to discuss future plans and assist with career interest discovery, FAFSA, scholarships, free application week, and more. The Trojan Pantry provides food items, personal hygiene products, and other supplies to current Troy University students. The pantry is located at Trojan Village 200 and is open twice a week for visitors and volunteers to organize and inventory donations. Civic Engagement hosts a week-long summer camp for 3rd-5th grade students each July. Campers learn the basics of American government, characteristics of a good citizen and how to be an active part of their community. They have the opportunity to meet and learn from local community heroes each day. explore volunteer opportunities Each year the Office of Civic Engagement teams up with Student Involvement to host its annual Canless Castle Contest. The food drive brings in more than 5,000 supplemental food items that keep our hunger initiatives well stocked to serve our campus and community for several months. During the contest, student organizations are encouraged to participate by donating nonperishable food items and come together for a couple of hours to construct their best “castle” using their donations. Castles are critiqued by a judge's panel and recognition is given to the organization who has the best castle design and the organization who donated the most items. There is a student organization division and a greek division. For sororities and fraternities, Greek Week points are also up for grabs. This fun and engaging activity provides an opportunity for students to be educated on the issue of food insecurity in Pike County and actively participate in addressing this need. The food donations collected this year will go to the Trojan Pantry serving college students, and our Backpack for Kids program (B4K) that serves local youth. Students volunteer weekly with B4K during the fall and spring semesters to pack bags supplemental food items that are delivered to youth in our community. Learn more and sign up here.

Compliance,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: When submitting a proposal or accepting an award, you as the investigator as well as TROY (as the fiscal agent), are committing to a number of assurances, certifications, terms, and conditions. It is very important that the investigator understand these compliance issues before submission and before an award is made. Below is information regarding a number of common compliance concerns that the investigator should be aware of, including those handled internally, such as the protection of human/animal subjects. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is comprised of TROY faculty and external representatives who review proposed research studies involving human subjects. The IRB ensures that the basic rights and welfare of research participants are fostered and protected. The IRB supports researchers through its coordinated activities in education, regulatory compliance oversight, and post approval monitoring. All research involving human subjects performed at TROY and/or by TROY students, staff, and/or faculty must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board prior to beginning the research. IRB policies The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) oversees the use of animals for research, teaching, and testing conducted at or by TROY. The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare defines an animal as any live, vertebrate animal used or intended for use in research, research training, experimentation, or biological testing or for related purposes. If your research includes live vertebrae animals please contact Dr. Sig Harden or Dr. Brian Helms for up to date procedures for approval. IACUC policies Troy University is committed to creating a research climate that promotes faithful adherence to high ethical standards in the conduct of research and scholarships without inhibiting the productivity and creativity of persons involved in research. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training plans are required by both NSF and NIH as well as USDA. Troy University has selected the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) online training to meet federal requirements in RCR. The CITI online courses are designed for faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students who have an interest or focus in the research areas targeted by federal support and serve to satisfy federal regulations that require RCR training as a part of grant. The modules contain information about responsible conduct in research, case studies and quizzes related to each of the areas. Research guidance and training resources Some funders now require that researchers supplement their grant proposals with a Data Management Plan (DMP). DMPs are short, formal documents that outline, at the onset of a new project, how you will handle your data both during your research and after the project is completed. They help to ensure that, in the present, your data are collected and analyzed in an intelligent and sustainable way, and that your data are able to be shared and preserved for future use and re-use. Data often have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. Researchers may continue to work on data after funding has ceased, follow-up projects may analyze or add to the data and data may be re-used by other researchers. Well organized, well documented, preserved and shared data are invaluable to advance scientific inquiry and to increase opportunities for learning and innovation. TROY federal partnerships with data must comply with all grantor, federal, state and local policies. Troy University IT policies The U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce regulate technology and/or information that is export-controlled under either the State Department's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulation (EAR). Export controlled technology and/or information includes activities, items, and information related to the design, development, engineering, manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, maintenance, operation, modification, demilitarization, destruction, processing, or use of items with a capacity for military operations. Usually this does not include basic marketing information on function or purpose; general system description, or information concerning general scientific, mathematical, or engineering principles commonly taught in schools, colleges, and universities or information in the public domain. Under ITAR and EAR regulations it is unlawful to send or take export-controlled technology and/or information out the United States; disclose orally or visually, or transfer export- controlled technology and/or information to the foreign person inside or outside the United States without proper authorization. A license may be required for foreign nationals to access export-controlled technology and/or information. A foreign national is a person who is not a U. S. citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, and makes no exceptions for foreign students. Questions regarding export controls should be directed to Troy Purchasing or Dr. Greg Price. The Jeanne Clery Act is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. The Clery Act was originally enacted by the Congress and signed into law by President George Bush in 1990 as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. The name later was renamed in honor of Jeanne Clery, a student murdered in 1986 at Lehigh University. Schools have to publish an annual report every year by October 1st that contains 3 years worth of campus crime statistics and certain security policy statements including sexual assault policies which assure basic victims' rights, the law enforcement authority of campus police and where students should go to report crimes. Below are the most recent statistics for Troy University. CRIME STATISTICS Conflict of Interest occurs when it is determined that an investigator has a significant financial interest that could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of external funds for research or education activities. The purpose of completing the COI disclosure form is to communicate all significant financial interests that are held personally (or by a spouse or dependent) that would reasonably appear to be affected by the research or educational activities funded (or proposed for funding) by a federal agency. Appearance is as important as reality where conflict of interest are concerned, so disclosing conflicts of interest is important. Disclosing a potential conflict of interest does not mean an actual conflict exists, but it could help eliminate the perception. Troy, in conjunction with CITI, has developed a web-based module in order to comply with this requirement. All recipients applying for federal funding (PIs and Independent Investigators described on the transmittal) must complete the initial training and COI disclosure form. Training must be completed prior to submitting your proposal. To complete online training, users need to register at the CITI Program site and affiliate their profile with Troy University. Please visit the following link to get started and complete the registration process: CITI - Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (citiprogram.org) The Conflicts of Interest (Basic Course) training module should take 15-20 minutes to complete.

COVID-19 campaigns,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The following campaigns were created in ENT2200: INNOVATION AND CREATIVE THINKING. Each project is designed to support mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students collaborated with graphic designers to produce these awareness campaigns. All campaigns are available for sponsorship and publication. For further information related to any campaign please contact: Edward Noriega, Director DTI.center, enoriega@troy.edu334 670-3393 Sticker campaign Slay COVID is all about reaching college students with the importance of wearing a mask properly. We believe that this pandemic is affecting everyone and we must protect ourselves and those around us. We will spread this message by producing stickers as well as a video commercial. We would like our campaign to be advertised on social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram. Our intention is to get people to wear masks in public and to wear masks correctly. We would like to see our campaign on social media, schools, and college campuses. This animation was made to bring awareness of wearing a mask in a comical, but serious manner. This campaign is intended to be shown in the Veterans Memorial Stadium, jumbotron. We also plan on showcasing it via Facebook, Instagram, and Tik Tok. I find it saddening that in our current world, that something as simple as wearing a piece of cloth is as controversial and who you are voting for this coming November. The issue of mask wearing is an issue concerning political affiliation, when in reality, it should just be an issue of caring for others. Some are referred to as sheep, and some are referred to as heroes, all because they chose to do the bare minimum to protect themselves and others from the COVID-19 virus. The statement is simple, care for others, and protect yourself and those close to you. With the current number of deaths just over 180,000, this is no hoax conspired by the democratic party to scare you into voting for Joe Biden. This is a real threat that we are all facing due to poor leadership, lack of responsibility, and simple ignorance. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, wear a damn mask. In response to the increasing case rate of COVID-19 I found it important to create a brand of face shields that would give people additional facial protection during this pandemic. Trojan Shield along with many other face shield brands is striving towards creating a more socially normal environment that everyone is happier in. Face shields allow visibility for verbal and nonverbal communication whereas face masks limit these verbal cues that we need to communicate efficiently. The goal of the Trojan Shield brand is to provide TROY University with another option of facial protection that is unique to TROY and allows normal social interaction to take place inside and outside of the classroom. Having different Trojan Shield models gives people the option to choose what is best suitable for their style. The Trojan Shields are 3D printed face shields, allowing anyone with a 3D printer access to downloading the files and print them using their own printer. The PPE Police wants to encourage Troy students to wear their face masks in the correct way. We want our fellow students to do their part to help keep our campus safe by sending in mask violation pictures that we will then post on our Instagram and Facebook pages. We want to use this platform as a way to enforce of the wearing of masks. We believe with this younger generation that using social media to mask-shame students will better reach our audience. Immunity: Protecting the Autoimmune, is an awareness campaign created to bring attention to at-risk students on campus and at-risk people in the community. In order to accomplish this goal, our team has created a graphic campaign to be used on social media and in physical locations around campus. Posters, masks, and T-shirts are just some of the ways we have used to get the word out. Our team would like to see the campaign used for the sole purpose of spreading awareness for autoimmune persons, and not to make unaffected persons feel like they are not doing enough to help. Our main concern is that people may feel like we are asking them to do more or act more cautiously, but in reality, we just want to give them another reason to stick with being safe until the pandemic is over. Our target audience is the people of Troy and Troy University students. The goal of our campaign is to inform the people that washing your hands can reduce your chance of getting Covid-19 drastically. We would like our campaign to be used by putting our creatively designed posters in troy University bathrooms. We want on the walls where people can see them as there walking in the bathroom. Our goal is to get college students to wear their masks in all social settings by respectfully reminding them to wear their masks and distributing our string bags. We need all students to wear their masks around others at all times to ensure the safety of each other. I would like to see my campaign used on college campuses and have our bags given to students on campus.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/business/departments/entrepreneurship-minor/covid-19-campaigns/index.html

Benchmarking,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Table of Contents Benchmarking is defined as an ongoing, systematic process for measuring and comparing the work processes of one organization or department to those of another by bringing an external focus to internal activities, functions, or operations. The goal of benchmarking is to provide key personnel in charge of processes with an external standard for measuring the quality and cost of internal activities and to help identify where opportunities for improvement may reside. Benchmarking doesn't have to be a mysterious and complicated process. Any person, department or organization can and should do it. At the core of benchmarking is the concept of learning and sharing. By comparing work processes and practices with others, you may gain valuable information that you can adapt to your own situation. Benchmarking is a useful tool that will help your department continually improve its processes by learning how others do it. To benchmark, you must first evaluate your own operation's processes to identify weaknesses and strengths; then you must identify, study, and adapt from others who may be doing it better! People within an organization become used to operating in certain ways. Even if those ways are harmful, most people resist change because the old way of doing business is so comfortable. What benchmarking does is challenge the old way. Regular benchmarking is like cleaning out your closet. You always find some things you don't need and a few things you didn't know you had, but could use. Regular benchmarking of critical functions and programs ensures that you and your managers and employees remain open to new ideas, evolving technologies and changing trends. The benchmarking process attempts to answer the following key questions: Regardless of the benchmarking method an organization chooses to use, the purpose is still the same. Benchmarking helps organizations to continually learn from their competitor and peer organizations. However, benchmarking involves more than just gathering data. It encompasses adapting a new approach to continually question how practices and processes are performed, seeking out best practices and processes, and implementing new models of operation. *Parts of this are paraphrased from: James G. Patterson, Benchmarking Basics, 1996, Crisp Publications, Inc. and from Jeffrey W. Alstete, Benchmarking in Higher Education, 1995, ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Reports.

"History, Mission and Collecting Policy","Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Researchers long have decried the lack of a significant archival repository to serve the Wiregrass region of Alabama, Florida and Georgia. In 1999, Troy State University Dothan President Michael Malone set in motion the Wiregrass Archives by negotiating the deposit of the congressional records of Rep. Terry Everett (AL-2) and by designating space for a repository in the R. Terry Everett Hall on the TUD campus. Library Director Julia Smith and an advisory committee secured a $142,000 grant to fund the archives through the federal government’s Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). This money has provided start-up consultation, physical plant, computers, printers and the archival supplies needed to process, make accessible and preserve the various collections that document both the Wiregrass region and Troy University Dothan. Also, the money was used to fund a portion of the salary needed to hire a professional archivist to manage the facility. Library Assistant Tina Bernath attended a two-week workshop in archival management provided by the Georgia Institute of Archivists and conducted the beginning work of the project until the arrival of Dr. Martin T. Olliff as archivist in January 2002. To accomplish its three-part mission, the Wiregrass Archives will follow the best practices of archival administration, as well as the guidelines established by its published collecting policy and the Public Universities Functional Analysis and Records Disposition Authority published by the State of Alabama. Historic manuscripts: The Wiregrass Archives collects records that document the following areas throughout the Wiregrass Region: Economic life: Includes records of entire industries and individual businesses engaged in agriculture, timber and naval stores, retail and wholesale marketing, healthcare and manufacturing. Also includes records of trade and commerce associations. Government and politics: Includes records of governing bodies at all levels, individual politicians and organizations that engage in political activities. Non-governmental civic life: Includes records of civic clubs, fraternal organizations, service clubs and churches. Folkways and high culture: Includes records that document vernacular culture (such a activities noted in Wiregrass Country by Jerrilyn McGregory) as well as high art, theater and literature. Of particular importance are records of visual, graphic and performing artists, along with Wiregrass Writers. Impact of the military on the region: Records not otherwise secured by law that document the presence of various military bases and personnel in the Wiregrass and their impact on the region. Research findings: Records scholars and researchers have compiled on history and life in the Wiregrass. Individual lives of community leaders and ordinary citizens: Personal papers, diaries, letters, business records, memoirs and oral histories from individuals and families who have lived in the Wiregrass. Troy University Dothan Campus Archives: The Wiregrass Archives provides records management consulting to the divisions of Troy University Dothan Campus and collects/preserves/makes accessible campus records of enduring value. It does so as guided by the State of Alabama RDA for Public Colleges and Universities. Coordinate information: The Wiregrass Archives recognizes that its staff cannot adequately provide the proper research environment by unilaterally collecting historical manuscripts. The Wiregrass Archives also recognizes that research about the Wiregrass is hindered if area manuscript repositories and archives compete for collections or ignore one another. Consequently, the Wiregrass Archives actively promotes cooperation and information sharing among repositories.

He was stationed in Gulfport, Mississippi, from where he drove once a month to take care of his house in Virginia Beach. Coincidentally, he noticed TROY’s billboard on I-65 between Evergreen and Georgiana, Alabama. Having finished his associate degree and retired from the U.S. Navy in 2015, he took TROY’s billboard and its location as a sign to become a Trojan. “I was planning to go to school and got accepted to a local Virginia Beach school, when I found out that Troy has an office in the next town over, Chesapeake,” he says. “I took that as a sign and applied there, rescinded my other acceptance and have been a Trojan ever since.” Daniel joined the Navy after high school and served 22 years as a boatswain’s mate on four ships: USS Enterprise, USS Arctic, USS Detroit and USS Ramage. A boatswain’s mate is responsible for anchoring, mooring and driving the ship, as well as conducting replenishments while underway, handling helicopter operations and driving small boats. After his retirement, he worked various jobs while continuing his classes with TROY Online. “After work I would go home, eat lunch and log in to my assignments,” he says. He says the flexibility and customizability of TROY’s online classes allowed him the opportunity to juggle the demands of his classes with his dual job. “The classes are short with weekly deadlines for assignments, which allows me to balance what courses to concentrate on each day,” he says. “I choose to frontload my weeks with class so I only need to monitor the discussions and announcements the rest of the week.” During winters (late October to March), he has been going to McMurdo Station, a United States Antarctic research center on the south tip of Ross Island in Antarctica, on a contract to work as a senior cargo handler since 2013. There, he organizes and processes all cargo heading to the field or home for further transport by air or vessel. As for people who are undecided about going back to school, Daniel says that the advisers and instructors are always ready to help, and life’s experiences can help in class, as well. “Anyone out there” can go back to school and juggle a job alongside, he says. “I wish I got started on it earlier.”",https://www.troy.edu/online/student-spotlight-daniel.html

Career Information for English and Humanities Graduates,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The career opportunities for English majors who hold a B.S. degree from Troy University are more expansive than most people might realize. Practically every type of business values good communication skills in their employees, and as graduates of Troy University's College of Communication and Fine Arts, students are prepared for careers that require excellent language and communication skills. Upon graduation, students may wish to enter careers in publishing, writing, editing, law, theology, finance, entertainment, health care, instructional design, government service, the arts, and teaching. Graduates who hold a B.S. degree in English Language Arts from Troy University are well prepared for a career in teaching, and most of Troy's ELA majors enter the teaching field. Feedback from these alumni indicates that they enjoy this profession, which generates community respect, a feeling of service, and a sense of accomplishment and civic pride. Teaching has long been a respectable profession, and since its foundation as a ""teacher's college,"" Troy University has educated and will continue to educate the next generation of teachers. The written form of English (long neglected in a society that communicated principally through the oral medium of the telephone) has assumed a professional importance in the digital age. At one time, a business office needed only one expert in written English (often a secretary who corrected all written communication to avoid embarrassing the company), but the digital era demands that everyone must possess good communication skills to succeed in today's global economy. An English major or minor can help graduates succeed in the computer age, where many professions such as online journalist, speech writer, video scripter, technical and manual writer, and creative or freelance writer demand that applicants possess ""Excellent Written and Oral Communication Skills,"" to borrow a phrase that has become almost a standard requisite among employers. Public relations, advertising firms, government agencies, consumer groups, TV news organizations, and market research companies – in fact, all groups dealing with corporate communications – are interested in English majors and minors because these graduates are well-trained in the essential skills of written and oral communication. Finally, some English majors continue their studies in graduate programs around the country to prepare for a career in teaching at the community college or university level. Teaching, however, is not the only graduate school option for English majors; some English majors enroll in law school or medical school. Law students with a major in English have honed their written and verbal communication skills, which serve them well throughout their legal career, and some medical schools look favorably on applicants with a background in English because the schools believe that a grounding in the liberal arts helps future doctors maintain their professional perspective on humanity. The career prospects for English majors and minors are not strictly limited to teaching, as once thought, but instead extend into many other aspects of society, including corporate America. The Department of English, therefore, invites you to study with us and consider a major or minor in English.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-communication-fine-arts/departments/english/career-information.html

"Welcome from the Chair of Economics, Finance, Risk Management and Insurance","Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The economics and finance programs were recently merged to create the Department of Economics and Finance within the Sorrell College of Business.

These paths will prepare students for careers in banking and finance, and exceptional students will be ready for the challenges of law school or graduate school. Our Finance professor, Robert Earl Stewart, helped drive some of the exciting curricular changes, and he describes our new program “The best thing to have happened to Finance in [his] 46 years at Troy University.” I agree with Robert Earl’s assessment and think the role of economics and finance is becoming increasingly important in today’s society. Whether a student only takes one course as part of their general education or earns a degree in Economics, the courses offered within our division will help students succeed in their post-college careers.

While many applicants may possess an undergraduate or graduate degree in Global Leadership, it is not a necessity. What the applicant needs to show is an unmistakable research focus on Global Leadership that mirrors the research agenda of a doctoral directive faculty member. A Ph.D. program is by nature a research-oriented degree; students will be expected to be actively engaged in research teams with faculty members and other doctoral students. As mentioned previously, the applicant must exhibit a research focus in Global Leadership. It is strongly recommended, although not required, that the applicant’s written sample show this focused area. The Ph.D. in Global Leadership at Troy University requires 63 credit hours. No more than 18 credits of post-master’s coursework or degrees or educational specialist coursework or degree or juris doctorate (J.D.) degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education will be eligible for recognition. No credit may be transferred to a Troy University graduate program until a student is unconditionally admitted and has successfully completed a minimum of 12 semester hours with the University. The maximum number of graduate credit hours transferred into a graduate program will not exceed 18 semester hours. Please consult specific degree programs to determine allowable transfer credit hours. *See the Troy Graduate Catalog General Regulations for further information. No. All of the doctoral core, research, and statistic classes will be offered at the doctoral (8800) level. Duplication of classes the student took in their Master’s at Troy University will not be permitted. According to a leading figure in Global Leadership, Troy University’s proposed Ph.D. in Global Leadership has the potential to fill a large, documented void in Global Leadership education by providing a heretofore unavailable reputable online and/or blended Ph.D. program that meets the needs of working professionals. In addition, executives and leaders who wish to advance their knowledge and understanding of Global Leadership would have their needs met through this Troy University Ph.D. program. Service members may want to pursue a doctorate in Global Leadership. However, due to military obligations, current members, as well as veterans, are often challenged in finding a program that can satisfy their desire for an advanced education. The proposed doctoral program in Global Leadership offers a format that will allow current members of the armed forces to fulfill their military obligations while providing them with an advanced educational opportunity to prepare them for life after the military. Specifically, a doctorate in Global Leadership from Troy University will allow military personnel to combine their previous experiences in leadership, management, organization, and operations with a curriculum that is designed to further enhance understanding and knowledge, including advanced leadership theories, organizational behavior, marketing, management and ethical and legal issues in Global Leadership. All of the classes, including all doctoral core, elective, research, and statistic classes will be offered online. The students must work with their advisor in scheduling all classes. All of the online classes will be offered through TROY Online. Classes will be offered in terms of nine (9) weeks. Presently, Troy University offers five, 9-week terms. The student may take more than the maximum with administrative approval. No. At the present time, no teaching assistantships are available. Students, in collaboration with their advisor, will be expected to assist in submitting proposals for presentations at national and international conferences. Moreover, it will be expected that students will work with their advisor to assist in writing and submitting for publications prior to embarking on the dissertation process. Exposure to writing and submitting research projects prepares doctoral students to understand and perform basic and applied research in their specialty area. The student may assist their advisor in writing grant proposals to fund potential research and also write their own grant proposal to fund their own research. Consistent with other terminal degree programs at TROY, the Global Leadership doctoral student will have a maximum time of eight (8) years for degree completion, inclusive of completing dissertation requirements. However, it is important to note that a full-time student (i.e., taking six credits per term) may be able to complete coursework in two (2) years. Additionally, dissertation may require one to two (1-2) years to fully complete.As a result, students can finish the program in as little as three (3) years. To do so, the students must communicate with their advisor on a regular basis. The Ph.D. Global Leadership program at Troy University not only provides the flexibility of taking classes online but also allows the student flexibility to determine their specific area of specialization: Organizational Leadership or Higher Education. To do so, the students will be required to work closely and receive approval from their major advisor for the classes. Generally, the cognate specialization area will reflect the classes taken outside of the doctoral core and the topic of the dissertation. The student must maintain a cumulative minimum of a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. An advisor will be assigned to you upon admittance to the program, and any questions in regard to registration or coursework should be answered by your faculty advisor. He or she will guide you in your coursework only. It is your responsibility to select a Dissertation Chair within 18 credit hours of starting the program. In other words, your current advisor will not necessarily be your Dissertation Chair, who will chair your comprehensive exam and dissertation. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you work closely with the doctoral faculty members during the first year of the program and choose a Dissertation Chair with his/her agreement. Dissertation credit hours may exceed, but may not be less than, the minimum of 12 credit hours. The number of hours the student takes per term should be in agreement with the major faculty advisor. Students must be continuously enrolled for a minimum of one (1) credit hour in Dissertation per term—after being admitted to candidacy, during and including the term in which they successfully defend their dissertation.

Charles Cahn Baum and Family Atrium,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University’s Rosa Parks Museum honors a family with roots in Montgomery by naming its atrium in memory of Charles Cahn Baum and in honor of his family. Reared in Montgomery in a prominent Jewish family, Charles Baum graduated from Princeton, Harvard Business School and the University of Maryland Law School. A resident of Baltimore, Md. for most of his life, he had a passion for civic and philanthropic causes, always maintaining his devotion to Alabama. He died in 2015. Patti Baum made a gift to the museum in her late husband’s memory in order to help fund new educational programs, such as the museum’s summer camp, and continue the mission of uplifting Mrs. Parks’ legacy. The choice of the museum to help continue her late husband’s legacy came as a result of his email response to a friend. The friend had seen the movie “Selma” and, knowing that Charles had grown up in Montgomery during the Civil Rights Movement, inquired as to what his life was like during those times. In that email response, Charles lamented about his family not being “brave nor courageous, nor willing to risk our own comfort for a greater cause.” “I want his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to know what his life was like growing up in Alabama during a period of great unrest,” Baum said. “I want them to know why he encouraged all of us relentlessly to speak out and stand up for what is right. I wanted to do something that Charles might have done had he not run out of time and I certainly wanted to honor his Alabama roots. Charles and Rosa Parks shared some things in common. They both had profound humility, a strong sense of decency, a truly good soul, a determination to fight for their beliefs, valued education, southern grace, open minds. Neither carried any hate in their hearts. They were authentic, gentle and kind and fiercely loyal to their friends. They both deeply loved family. It is a tribute to them both – Mrs. Parks and Charles – that you are all here today.” Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us this evening. It's so good to see the Baum family!

Parent Information,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: We, who make up the faculty and staff, hope your daughter will enjoy being a part of our campus. You will find Troy University has many varied activities and organizations in which your daughter can become involved and a sorority is one of those options. Many moms and dads ask me what sororities are like and how their daughters go about becoming part of a sorority. Sororities at Troy University are made up of women with varying backgrounds and interests. Sororities provide structured and planned activities to enhance their members' college years. For example, if there is a pep rally, the members get together, make signs and go support the Trojans. A sorority may have a speaker address them on the topic of successful job interviewing technique. Perhaps your daughter loves to play sports, the sororities sponsor intramural teams in which she can participate. Our sorority women also believe in helping others, you can find them tutoring children in after school programs and playing bingo with the elderly. Sororities encourage their members to participate in all aspects of campus life and support their efforts. I want to point out our sororities realize that their members' first priority is their academics. I am proud to say that the all-sorority grade point average is consistently higher than the all-women's grade point average. Sorority life has brought much happiness to the women who have been a part of it. The decision whether to participate in membership recruitment is a difficult but important one. We hope this website will help your daughter become familiar with sorority life and help her make that decision. Also, during IMPACT, the sorority women and I will be present to answer any questions and to meet with you and your daughter. Whatever decision your daughter makes, we hope your family will love being a part of the Troy University family. Dr. Korrie Lynn Williamson Panhellenic Advisor/ Associate Dean of Student Services We know safety and security is a primary concern for parents. We want you to know our sorority houses are regularly patrolled by University Police and because they are so close to the City of Troy police station they keep an eye on sorority hill. Each sorority has a group of alumnae volunteers who work very closely with the sorority to make sure the sorority is operating as it should be. When a sorority hosts a social event every effort is made to make sure the event is safe. Security is hired, they travel on buses, adult chaperones are present and the sororities expect the host establishment to enforce the legal drinking age to ensure safety. Women found in violation of underage drinking are subject to discipline within their sorority which may very well mean losing their membership. Sororities help their members to see they can have a good time while maintaining high standards. Please remember your daughter is ultimately responsible for her behavior and while the sorority will encourage safe behavior, if she engages in risky behavior she endangers her life and others. Our sorority women believe in looking out for each other, but they will not tolerate members who do not maintain a high standard of behavior. We know sorority life is not for every woman. We do want you to know that Fall recruitment is the major time sororities take in new members. Sometimes parents will say their daughter does not want to join until spring semester. We rarely have openings in sororities during spring semester. There might be a few openings in a couple of sororities spring semester but that is unpredictable. Sororities design their programs to help their new members get acclimated to college very quickly. Last Fall semester the overall GPA of sorority women was a 3.26. The undergraduate female GPA was a 3.11. You can see the sororities are serious about grades and getting their members acclimated to campus. If your daughter does not go through recruitment this August and still wants to join a sorority, please encourage her to do so her sophomore year. To some college women and their parents, joining a sorority sounds terrific. They want to have something to help them socially and academically while providing structure. But, some look at it as too restricting and too time demanding. Each student needs to look at their strengths and weaknesses and evaluate what they can do. Some questions they need to be think through are, do they want to go to weekly meetings, have required study hours, maintain a high standard of behavior, attend and participate in campus events and volunteer in the community. If this is too overwhelming, then do not encourage them to participate. Our campus has wonderful campus ministries, lots of service and leadership organizations and many athletic and cultural events to attend. There are many successful students at Troy University who do not join sororities. The first cost cost associated with sorority life is the $60.00 recruitment fee with a $5.00 handling fee. The first semester there will be $600 to $700 in ONE TIME fees. Some of those fees will be paid on Bid Day or very quickly afterward. Most of these ONE TIME fees go to the national organization as pledging, initiation and/or insurance costs. All our sororities bill online through national companies their national organizations have set up. Each sorority has a different way of billing whether it be monthly or by the semester. The good news is if your daughter shares with you her user name and password to the online billing system you can have access to her account. Monthly dues run around $140. Some chapters may be a little less some a little more. Once all bills are paid for a year most sororities cost about the same on this campus. Dues are used for the operation of the sorority. Examples of chapter operations – sponsoring an intramural team, sisterhood events for the chapter, tailgating for a football game, sisterhood and recognition events, formals, date parties, etc. T-shirts are not included in dues and t-shirts are very popular especially their first year. Sororities do not charge dues during the summer. College can be a tough transition for a student. Some students are eager and anxious to handle everything while others are still expecting “momma” to do everything. Please let them sign up for recruitment on their own. Do not fill out their online application for them. Encourage her to carefully read the instructions and fill it out on her own – this way any mistakes made are her fault, not yours. Feel free to assist her, but let her do the entering in. Move in day for those living in the residence hall is Saturday, August 3, 2024 and Sunday, August 4, 2024 from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. If your daughter has indicated on her online recruitment form that she is living on campus, we notify Housing, and they will be ready for her to check in. You will just go to the residence hall lobby she is assigned to and resident assistants will be there to check her in. You will not be assigned a specific day or time to check in. You can just arrive anytime between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm on Saturday or Sunday. Please do not call the Housing Office and ask about move in for sorority recruitment. While we closely coordinate with them, they will just refer you to us. If you have questions call 334-670-3204. It is important to realize that the University rents out residence halls during the summer to conferences. Because we are coming back early some conferences may just have checked out the day before you arrive, so sometimes rooms are not clean when you check in. Housing does its best to avoid this but it sometimes happens, please be patient with this. It should take you about an hour to an hour and half to unload your car. At that time, we suggest that you leave your daughter to unpack and set up her room. She will also have time during the week to do so. Everything does not need to be perfect and in place before you leave. Also, we ask that unless you are from very far away, do not stay in Troy for all of sorority recruitment. There will be little time for you to visit with your daughter as she will be busy with recruitment. We understand there is a natural urge to stay and protect her, but the best way for her to adjust is to make friends with those going through recruitment with her and spend time with them. We do want you to know that many moms and dads are wonderful volunteers for our sororities once the girls join. Many parents will come down and help behind the scenes with all kinds of sorority projects. Many parents will grill for tailgates and provide meals during sorority recruitment. So once your daughter joins a sorority, they would love for you to help. We know many women going through recruitment will not live on campus. One problem we know happens every year is that apartment complexes will not let the women move in for recruitment. You need to let the complexes know well in advance and ask them to cooperate. If they will not cooperate, your daughter needs to try and bunk in with friends. As a last resort she may want to stay in a hotel. Another challenge that arises is that potential new members are not allowed to live with sorority women the week of recruitment. The sorority woman is the one who is to find an alternate place to live. Your daughter and the sorority woman should work this out well in advance. Also, if you and your daughter live in the Troy area and are willing to take a potential new member in for the week of recruitment, please let us know. Sorority Recruitment week is for students only. Families are invited to attend Bid Day and most do. Bid Day is when each potential member learns what sorority she has been placed in. Families should be at sorority hill by 9:30 am. Because parking is limited at sorority hill we will have buses running from the Trojan Center parking lot to sorority hill from 9:00 am on for families to ride on. The women will be released from Elm Street gym no later than 10:00 am. After the women are released from the gym, they will go over to their sorority house and have pictures taken. Each sorority will have a quick meeting with parents. After about an hour, families leave and the members stay behind for lunch, get to know you games, swim parties, etc. which usually go well into the evening. So if you live close by we encourage you to attend. If you are coming from a far distance you will want to carefully consider whether or not you want to attend as you will not spend much time with your daughter that evening. If you can't attend it is nothing to worry about. Only students are allowed in Elm Street gym during the distribution of bids. This is a very legitimate concern. We understand your daughter may get her feelings hurt by either not getting into a sorority or not getting into the one she had her heart set on. When women sign up for recruitment they are put into one of two groups that are called the Primary Pool and the Secondary Pool. The primary pool is composed of women who graduated from high school in 2024. The secondary pool is composed of women who graduated from high school before 2024. Most women in the secondary pool have completed some college hours. Each group during recruitment is treated separately to help with maximum placement of traditional freshmen and upperclassmen. Last year we had 222 women begin recruitment and 199 pledged. Encourage your daughter to consider all her options and be open minded she will have a greater chance of pledging. If your daughter is released from recruitment we have sorority women called Pi Chis who will notify them and help them if needed. Some released potential new members select to stay involved in their group activities. The Pi Chis also try to encourage them to get involved in other campus activities. It is important that your daughter realize sorority recruitment is like any other selection process. Job interviews, scholarship interviews, and team selections are a part of all our experiences. Sometimes we get selected and sometimes we do not. Putting her best foot forward with her recruitment application and preparing to meet and greet the sorority sisters is a very important life lesson. We hope that you will talk to her about her preparation for recruitment and how to handle disappointment if she should be released. If you were a member of a sorority, you might remember sorority recruitment as a process where the sorority extend invitations to the women to attend their parties and the women accepted or regretted those invitations. This model of recruitment no longer exists. Also, you may remember the terms “rush”, “rushee”. We no longer use those terms. You can see that those terms have been replaced by recruitment and potential new member. We use a model of recruitment called priority accept model based on statistics. Our overall goal is to place as many women as possible into sororities. To give an example, the first day of sorority recruitment she goes to 6 sororities and the next day she may go to 4 sororities. Your daughter will after the first round tell us which 4 sororities she would like to attend the next day and then rank the other sororities. Then the sororities gives us their list of women they would like back. Our system first tries to see which of those 4 have invited her back. If one does not invite her back, the system then tries to see if she was invited back to her next preference. Then potential member then receives a schedule letting her know where she will go. This process is repeated the next round. Please note that the rankings of your daughter and of the sororities are confidential and are not released to anyone. Each sorority at Troy University has something unique and wonderful to offer your daughter just as she has talents to offer each sorority. If your daughter goes into recruitment with the idea of only pledging one or two sororities she is setting herself up for disappointment. Encourage her to look for what is the best in every sorority she visits and to envision how she could make a difference in that group. Encourage her to remain positive and make decisions for herself. Many people love to give “advice” on sorority recruitment and when you start telling your friends your daughter is going through recruitment at Troy you will understand this. Please encourage her to make her decisions based on her experience in recruitment, not someone else's opinions. Recommendations are the most misunderstood part of sorority recruitment. A recommendation is like a letter of reference. You will hear many people tell you many different things about recommendations, most of which are untrue. First, it is the sorority's responsibility to get a recommendation for your daughter. If she signs up early a sorority should have no problem getting a recommendation from your hometown. If she signs up late, they will scramble to find a recommendation, but will do so if they wish to pledge her. We know in the state of Alabama everyone believes they must actively seek and get recommendations for their daughter. If you wish to do so, that is fine. Feel free to ask your friends who are sorority alumnae to write your daughter a recommendation. Many parents will tell us they don't know anyone who is a sorority alumnae. Just start telling friends and associates that your daughter is going through sorority recruitment at Troy and you will be surprised at how many will tell you of their Greek affiliation and offer to write a recommendation. Each national sorority has forms, most of which are now online (but user name and password protected). The actual form does not have to be filled out. We have provided the e-mail addresses of the sororities and if you know of a sorority alumnae who wishes to write a recommendation encourage her to email the sorority a reference. If the sorority wants the alumnae to fill out a form they will send it to her. Also, another big misconception is how many recommendations are necessary. Only one recommendation per sorority is needed. In the state of Alabama for some reason, rumors fly around you must have a certain number or the sorority won't consider you. This is not true. They do not have to be a Troy University graduate to write a recommendation, but they do need to be an alumnae of a Troy sorority. For example your friend may be an alumni of Alpha Delta Pi, but was an undergraduate at the University of Alabama. It is fine for her to write the recommendation. Yes. In sorority recruitment the sororities look at the group of freshman women and the group of upperclassmen women in two separate pools. So they will give every consideration to each pool of women. Most women who go through recruitment are freshman. During recruitment, your daughter will already be in the residence hall she is assigned to (if living on campus). The sorority houses generally are full when the sororities come back in August. On occasion a space might become open and if so they will let their new members know and see if they have any volunteers to move in. Sorority house prices are comparable to residence hall prices. At some point in your daughter's time in Troy she may be asked to move in the sorority house. Generally the houses have waiting lists for those women wanting to move in. You will want to be careful every year to know what the sorority would expect of your daughter before signing a lease. The Housing Office will allow a woman to move from a residence hall space to a sorority house space with no penalty. Our Panhellenic Council has rules that govern sorority recruitment. These rules are to protect your daughter. Your daughter may have friends who are already in sororities at Troy. It is perfectly fine for their normal friendship to remain as usual. It is important your daughter not let people overstep their boundaries where recruitment is concerned. Often sorority members, their mothers and alumnae will overstep the boundaries of appropriate contact and place their chapter and potential members in awkward positions. Here are some examples: Sororities at Troy consider their legacies very carefully. They will not decide to pledge someone just because she is a legacy. A legacy is someone whose mother, grandmother, or sister is a member of a sorority. Misconceptions about legacies abound. First, national policies vary concerning legacies. Troy University has three rounds of sorority recruitment. A sorority may or may not be required by their national organization to invite a legacy back to the second round of parties. Because we only have three rounds, most of our sororities are not obligated to invite a legacy back to the second round. Second, legacies are given the same amount of consideration as non-legacies. A woman will not get into a sorority just because she is a legacy. Third, if your daughter is released, the relative may or may not be notified by the sorority that your daughter has been released. Finally, if your daughter is a legacy, we know it is a natural tendency to lean toward that sorority. We certainly understand that. But, encourage her to go through recruitment with an open mind and to make new friends at all the sororities during recruitment.

National Pan-Hellenic Sororities & Fraternities,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) at Troy University welcomes you to the experience of Greek Life! NPHC is the governing body of the nine (9) largest historically African American Greek-letter fraternities and sororities, currently representing over 1.5 million members internationally. The organization boasts a diverse membership comprised of students, celebrities, corporate, political and community leaders. NPHC organizations are all unique with respect to other Greek-letter organizations in that they embrace a service-oriented philosophy and aim to promote the continuance of social action, political empowerment, and economic development. The National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations are profoundly committed to providing community service and uplifting and promoting the general public welfare. These services are implemented within the local, national, and international communities. NPHC Convocation is an open forum for interested students to learn more about our chapters. Each chapter gives a brief background on its national history and chapter history, shares its involvement on campus and in the local community, and answers questions you may have about the organization's Membership Intake Process.

Troy University's Alpha Alpha Lambda Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Troy University's Chapter of Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. Not currently active on TROY's campus. The National Pan-Hellenic Council was established in 1930 at Howard University as a national coordinating body for the nine historically African-American fraternities & sororities, which had evolved on American college and university campuses by that time. Blatant racism had prevented many African American students on historically white campuses from joining general fraternities and sororities. African Americans were denied admittance to large numbers of campuses, which still prohibited blacks from attending. Therefore, African American students on both types of campuses established fraternities and sororities to enhance their college experiences. These organizations did not then, nor do they now, restrict membership to African Americans. They have developed, however, a distinctive African American style in their activities, both social and philanthropic. These college fraternities grew, on historically white and historically black campuses in three distinct phases: Post World War I:NPHC chapters spread to major research university campuses that admitted blacks. Spread to major historically black colleges in the south. Alumni chapters established in cities across the U.S.A. as ""Civic and Service"" organizations because blatant racism prohibited African Americans from participating in general civic organizations in their communities after graduation from college. Post World War II:NPHC chapters proliferated on southern historically black college campuses. Many cultural traditions which differed markedly from historically white college traditions became refined and embedded within the African American culture, i.e., ""lining,"" chanting & public skits on campus as a part of ""pledging""). Post Civil Rights Act 1964:Many colleges and universities that had previously denied admittance to African Americans or had small enrollments grew in their enrollment of African Americans and established NPHC chapters on their campuses. This swelled the number of NPHC affiliate organizations to over 400 undergraduate chapters and as many alumni chapters on average for each organization. Presently, approximately 1.5 million members of undergraduate and graduate chapters are served by NPHC. In many ways, though welcomed, this upsurge in growth was unexpected and unplanned for by NPHC. By and large, even though the national office staffs of each of the nine affiliate organizations have increased dramatically, they have not matched the pace of growth of the chapters. None of the historically African American fraternities or sororities have staffed their offices with field consultants (young, recent college graduate members of the respective organizations who actively visit college chapters to motivate, evaluate and sometimes recommend discipline for chapters that stray from the national or university standard). Historically, African American fraternities and sororities and their office staff must also give appropriate time and attention to alumni chapters. This further diminishes the time and attention proportionately that can be paid to collegiate affairs. In 1992, through the joint cooperation of Indiana University-Bloomington and the National Board of Directors of NPHC, the first permanent national office for NPHC was established in Bloomington, Indiana, on the campus of Indiana University. Prior to its establishment, for over a 62-year period, the national office would sojourn from one officer to the next. NPHC changed its national constitution in 1993 at the National Convention to allow for the appointment of its first Executive Director, Dr. Michael V. W. Gordon. At the same convention, NPHC changed its constitution to create the possibility for like organizations to apply for membership. In 1995, the first international council was chartered in Nassau, Bahamas. In 1996, Iota Phi Theta Fraternity joined as its ninth affiliate member. To understand the need for and concept of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc., one must first consider, understand and familiarize oneself with the historical accounts and significance of predominantly Black Greek-letter organizations. While having their own distinct heritages, the nine (9) member organizations of NPHC offer insight and a unique perspective into this understanding and the development of Black socioeconomic and cultural life. Each of the nine (9) NPHC organizations evolved during a period when African Americans were being denied essential rights and privileges afforded to others. Racial isolation on predominantly white campuses and social barriers of class on all campuses created a need for African Americans to align themselves with other individuals sharing common goals and ideals. With the realization of such a need, the African American (Black) Greek-lettered organization movement took on the personae of a haven and outlet, which could foster brotherhood and sisterhood in the pursuit to bring about social change through the development of social programs that would create positive change for Blacks and the country. Today, the need remains the same. While NPHC affiliate organizations recognize the social aspect of Greek college life, the primary purpose and focus of member organizations remains community awareness and action through educational, economic, and cultural service activities. NPHC affiliates and their respective members have pledged to devote their resources to service in their respective communities, realizing that the membership experience of NPHC organizations goes beyond organizational membership during an individual's college career. A lifetime commitment to the goals and ideals of each respective organization is stressed. The individual member is also expected to align himself with a graduate/alumni chapter following graduation from college, with the expectation that he/she will attend regular chapter meetings, regional conferences, and national conventions and take an active part in matters concerning and affecting the community in which they live. The need to form campus-based councils to represent NPHC affiliate organizations is not motivated by a “separatist” philosophy. The establishment of councils assists in maintaining a distinct identity as “service-based organizations,” as opposed to organizations that may be strictly social in nature; NPHC, Inc. does not advocate a disassociation from NIC, NPC, or NALFO organizations on college campuses. The council's purpose is to promote unity and expose members to the “service for life” philosophy and foster leadership development and scholarship. Furthermore, the National Pan-Hellenic Council provides a forum for participation and interaction among the members of affiliate organizations and the organizations themselves. It provides for a stronger unified voice and a stronger unified body. The continued advocacy for the establishment of local councils not only stems from tradition, but also from the realization that many colleges and universities maintain organization registration policies requiring an organization to belong to a national organization and that national organization to a national umbrella organization in order to function on that respective campus. It is the endeavor of NPHC, Inc. to foster a more stable environment on campuses for local NPHC councils, provide a forum for dialogue, and provide training for and management of its respective councils. Having such an entity in place to serve as an umbrella organization centralizes and provides a clearinghouse for information sanctioned by the NPHC Council of Presidents, whether on the university/college campus and/or in civic, social, and political arenas. It is essential to have such a voice to advocate the concerns of local councils and assert the position of the national body, particularly in decisions or rulings that may have a negative impact.

The Arboretum is open to the public from sunrise until sunset seven days a week.

Part of the inaugural State Economic and Infrastructure Development (SEID) grant program, the $19 million investment will fund projects that align with priorities identified in SCRC’s authorizing statute, Five-Year Strategic Plan and State Economic Development Plans. Five Alabama projects were selected to receive funding totaling $1.18 million. Dr. Alvin Diamond, biology professor and Director of the Arboretum, said most of the funds will be used for restoring the Hickory Loop Nature Trail. “The only options we have to get to that area are to climb down the bank of the creek, step across the creek and then climb up the bank on the other side—which is not convenient—or to walk down Pell Avenue to the corner and go in there,” he said, “but that’s not a good option either because of speeding and traffic. And now that we’ve got the all-terrain wheelchair, we want to install bridges and boardwalks to everyone can get across to these new trails.” The Arboretum’s entrance will also receive upgrades with the installation of a wildlife viewing area, informational signs and updates to the pitcher plant bog and rain garden. Benches and waste bins will also be installed along the trails. This is the largest grant the arboretum has received since restoration efforts began in early 2022. Updates continue to be made to the entrance area that features a rain garden, a pitcher plant bog and a stream that is currently undergoing restoration.

As of March, it is also a designated stop on the Alabama Birding Trails. The community is invited to visit the trails and volunteer. For more information on how to get involved, contact Diamond at adiamond@troy.edu or 334-670-3938. To stay up-to-date on the latest projects, visit the arboretum’s Facebook page. About the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC)The SCRC is a federal-state partnership authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill to promote and encourage economic development in areas of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and all of Florida. SCRC invests in projects that support basic infrastructure, business development, natural resources, and workforce/labor development. SCRC’s mission is to help create jobs, build communities, and improve the lives of those who reside in the 428 counties of the seven-state region. In the distance, there were sounds of a city. The hum of traffic, the occasional honking of horns. Voices and a boom box. But, just down the trail, the sounds of Mother Nature hushed - the chatter of squirrels, the singing of birds, the humming of bees, rustling in the brush. And, then there were voices. Excited voices. Troy University Professor Dr. Alvin Diamond, Jonathan Miller, a lecturer and biologist; Rose Horn, a graduate student; and volunteers Clark Harris and Joshua Bailey were just where they wanted to be and doing exactly what they want to do – bringing back the beauty of and purpose for the Troy University Arboretum. The Arboretum is a treasure for the university, the city of Troy and all who will come to enjoy the “fruits” of Mother Nature. That was the consensus of the group. “And the Arboretum has been left to linger too long.” The Arboretum has recently been returned to the university’ biology department and efforts are underway to bring the 75-acre Arboretum back to where it has been and beyond. A $5,000 grant from Bass Pro Shop was seed money for the projects that are underway including the replacement of the deck on the education complex building. The roof is also in need of repair. “The plan is to get the facility usable again,” Diamond said. “It can be useful for schools, for groups including the Pike County Treasure Forest, master gardeners. The interest of the volunteers is not limited to but focuses on the pond. “We’d like to clear around the pond. It’s great view when you can see it,” Josh said. “We’ve been out on the water a few times but we want to get canoes back out on the pond.” The arboretum includes walking trails that total under six miles but only one mile is now open. “A lot of debris has to be cleared and it includes a lot of big logs,” Clark said. “Dr. Diamond said the logs will probably be used to line the trails rather than trying to remove them.” Rose is in graduate school, mainly due to her interest in the restoration of the arboretum. “This is such a great place with all kinds of wildlife and vegetation,” she said. “I want to be a part of bringing the arboretum back to life and making it a destination for those who enjoy nature.” For Miller, the arboretum will be a place for students to come to learn and to enjoy and for the community as well. “More classes can be taught out here and we can also have labs, “Miller said. “There are many teaching and learning opportunities that will be available, not just for university students, but high school and elementary students and also the community.” Diamond said the arboretum is a natural park in the midst of a busy city. “It’s a place where people can come to enjoy nature in many different ways, alone or with others,” he said. “We are excited about the progress that is being made and the many opportunities the arboretum will offer our community.” Troy University’s Arboretum was recently awarded $4,000 total in grants from the Wiregrass Resource, Conservation and Development Council and Walmart for continued upgrades and improvements. Dr. Alvin Diamond, Arboretum director and biology professor, said the $3,000 grant from Wiregrass RC&D will be used to re-install kiosks near the trailheads of the Magnolia Loop and Meadow Loop half-mile trails, along with placing markers with scientific and common names for plants to assist in re-establishing the self-guided nature trail. “These were self-guiding nature trails with marked stops that identified interesting plants or habitats and had an accompanying trail guide which provided information about each stop. In addition, there were individual markers throughout the arboretum providing the common and scientific names of plants along the trails, and two kiosks with maps, arboretum rules and educational posters,” he said. “Due to storm damage, lack of maintenance, age and vandalism, the trails at the arboretum have been closed for a number of years. The trails have been cleared and we are now ready to identify the plant species.” The plant identification markers will also feature a QR code that will allow visitors to scan the code and be directed to a website that will provide more information on the plant. Additional information will include nativity, human and wildlife uses, cultural information and interesting facts and will be developed by students in the Tri Beta Honor Society within the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences. The $1,000 grant from Walmart will be used to create a pitcher plant bog. Pitcher plants are carnivorous plants that trap and digest insects and small animals. Volunteers planted saplings across the grounds of the arboretum in December.Diamond said the outpouring of support over the last year since the College of Arts and Sciences regained care of the arboretum has made all the difference in its rehabilitation. In addition to other grants, the arboretum has been flooded with faculty and student volunteers as well as volunteers from community organizations, like the Kiwanis Club and local Girl Scout troops. “The community support has been great. It’s wonderful to have help to get us back to at least where we used to be. We’ve made a lot of progress. It’s been a daunting task to undertake, but we’re really starting to see the progress,” he said. “I didn’t know how long it was going to take, I just knew we were going to get it done one way or another. We encourage everyone to come out and see what we’re doing and enjoy the arboretum.” The Arboretum encompasses 75-acres and features seven and a half miles of nature trails, over 500 identified plant species, a pond, an outdoor classroom and an indoor classroom. Classes are currently being held in the newly-renovated outdoor classroom, and an area has been cleared for a pollinator garden for bees, butterflies and other important pollinators. Future upgrades will feature removing invasive species, planting native azaleas and magnolias and establishing a wildflower garden. Four trails are open for use. Dogs and bikes are welcome. A TROY Foundation account has been created to accept donations. Those interested in volunteering can contact Diamond by phone at 334-670-3938 or by email at adiamond@troy.edu.

IRPE Effectiveness,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The effectiveness component of IRPE involves coordinating the online Institutional Planning and Effectiveness System as well as coordinating University assessment measures including the Graduating Student Survey, the New Student Survey, the Alumni Survey, the Employer Survey, the Major Field Tests in selected disciplines and the ETS Proficiency Profile—a national standardized examination to assess the effectiveness of the general studies program. In addition, IRPE staff members publish reports (online and in hard copy formats) from results of these assessment instruments. After August 1, 2005, when the three separately accredited institutions—Troy State University Dothan, Troy State University Montgomery and Troy State University—officially merged to become Troy University, transition to a new Institutional Planning and Effectiveness (IP & E) online system began. The new system was developed to meet the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) Core Requirements and Comprehensive Standards for Institutional Effectiveness and Planning in The Principles of Accreditation: Foundations for Quality Enhancement. To meet Institutional Effectiveness requirements in the online system, all programs of the University (Academic and Non-Academic) define their expected outcomes or student learning outcomes with assessment measures, measure the outcomes through assessment data gathered on an ongoing basis, build Plans for Improvement (PFI) for outcomes not met, and report assessment results with improvements made based on assessment annually in the online Institutional Planning and Effectiveness system. Outcomes met are captured in the evidence of improvement file and can be included in annual achievement reports and the Chancellor’s Mid-Year Review. In addition to University-wide surveying, testing and coordinating of the online IP & E System, IRPE is responsible for the Institutional Effectiveness Committee (IEC) which reviews all existing University Programs over a three-year period (one third per year) and which reviews all revised programs, new programs and substantive change prospectuses to verify that institutional effectiveness requirements are met. 011 Adams Administration BuildingTroy, Alabama 36082Phone: 334-670-3803Fax: 334-670-3815",https://www.troy.edu/about-us/offices-departments/institutional-research-planning-effectiveness/effectiveness/index.html

The purpose of the Master of Science degree in Criminal Justice is to broaden and enhance each student's ability to understand, analyze and evaluate issues that confront the American criminal justice system. The objectives of the program's core coursework are (a) the analysis of personnel situations in light of standard personnel processes applying major personnel laws and regulations to situations arising in criminal justice organizations; (b) demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of criminal law and procedures as evidenced by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions; (c) critically evaluate the scholarly evidence considering the effectiveness of various crime control policies employed by the police, the courts, and the correctional system with both juvenile and adult offenders; and (d) explain situations in criminal justice and criminal behavior by applying various criminological theories; and (e) demonstrate an ability to appropriately apply various research designs and methodologies in criminal justice situations. Specific institutional objectives of the program are as follows: The minimum requirement for admission to the Master of Science program in Criminal Justice is a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited four-year institution. Students who desire to enter this program but do not have a degree in criminal justice, police administration, law enforcement, or corrections may be required to meet other criteria such as additional coursework regarding undergraduate or professional preparation. Significant professional experience may be considered. However, admission to the program does not imply official admission for the degree. Unconditional Admission Hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum overall undergraduate grade point average of 2.5 (4.0 scale) or a 3.0 grade point average on the last 30 semester hours. All hours attempted in the term in which the 30 semester hours were reached will be used to calculate the grade point average. Conditional Admission Conditional Admission does not apply to this program. A maximum of four courses (12 semester hours) taken at another regionally accredited institution each with a grade of “B” or better can be applied toward the degree. These courses must be comparable in catalog description to Troy University courses in the Criminal Justice Graduate Program and be approved by the main campus dean/department chair. If the student transfers a “core” or “required course,” he/she is still subject to a written comprehensive exam based on the material presented at Troy University. Students completing the degree program with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, a grade of “B” or better in CJ 6650 Research Methods for Criminal Justice and passing a written comprehensive exam will be eligible to be awarded the degree of Master of Science in Criminal Justice. If the student makes a “D” or “F” in a core course, the course must be retaken. If the student makes a “D” or “F” in an elective course, the course may either be retaken or another elective taken in its place. The Master of Science in Criminal Justice is a 30 semester hours program. Students may select either Criminal Justice Studies or Security Studies Concentration.

About the College,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Troy University’s College of Education is historically the foundation of the university and we continue to uphold the traditions and values of teaching and advocate the sound clinical practices of all our graduates to reflect the university’s worldwide mission. From its roots as a state normal school providing teacher training to its current role at Troy University, the College of Education’s tradition of teaching excellence dates to its founding on February 26, 1887, when an act of the Alabama Legislature established Troy Normal School as an institution to train teachers for Alabama’s schools. From the outset, the institution quickly earned a reputation for innovation and accessibility. In 1893, the school was renamed Troy State Normal College. In 1899, the college is separated from the Troy City Schools system. Troy State Normal College offered extension courses for teachers and granted teaching certificates until 1929 when the State Board of Education changed the charter of the institution and renamed it Troy State Teachers College. Troy State Teachers College, offered its first master's degree program in 1957 and awarded the first master's degree in education in 1958. In 1967, Gov. Lurleen B. Wallace appointed eight members to the newly established Troy State College Board of Trustees, removing the institution from the control of the State Board of Education. In 2005, the separately accredited campuses were merged into a single university structure forming Troy University and thus bringing the College of Education together under one administrative body. The ITP (Interpreter Training Program) was added under the umbrella of College of Education programs in 2008. In January of 2009, the College of Education was moved from McCartha Hall into their new building Jack Hawkins Jr. Hall located on the Troy campus. The College of Education also enjoys partnerships with Outreach Programs ACCESS, AMSTI, Technology in Motion and SEARIC (Inservice). College of Education programs are available in Dothan, Global Campus Sites, Montgomery, Phenix City, Troy and Troy online.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/education/about-college/index.html
Campus Welcome,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Welcome to Troy University, known for its outstanding students, faculty and staff. At TROY you will find an exciting and challenging educational experience. There are nearly 15,000 students studying throughout the four major TROY campus locations in Alabama and at sites located around the world. TROY may be a large university that is spread out over multiple campus locations, but it has a “small college feel” where faculty and staff know students by their names and not by their student numbers. Our Montgomery Campus, located in the heart of downtown Montgomery, Alabama is unique in many ways. The outstanding faculty and staff are dedicated to serving our students ranging from traditional-aged students who have recently graduated from high school to adult learners who are returning to college to start a second career. Many of our students are employed, have families and numerous other commitments, which is why some elect the convenience of taking their courses online, while still being able to take advantage of receiving in person assistance and support on campus. The keys to our success in serving nontraditional students is the result of hard work and dedication from our TROY faculty and staff. They genuinely care about each student. Many of our faculty and staff completed their degree programs while “juggling” jobs and family responsibilities; therefore, they understand very well the demands that our students face in trying to achieve their educational goals. I know you will find the faculty and staff professional, friendly and helpful. Students also have access to all the degree programs and courses offered at other TROY campuses and sites around the world. Courses transfer seamlessly between TROY locations with no credits being lost. You can start most degree programs on one campus and complete them anywhere in the world via TROY’s outstanding online program. In reality, TROY is just “One Big Campus!” I invite you to learn more about us by continuing to explore our website. If you still have questions that were not answered, give us a call. Better yet, stop by for a visit! I very much hope that you will come and be part of the TROY family. While you’re on the Montgomery Campus, plan a visit to TROY’s Rosa Parks Museum, and The Davis Theatre for the Performing Arts.

For more information about the history of the organization, please visit Sigma Theta Tau International. As early as 1973 former Dean Betty Thomas contacted Sigma Theta Tau for information concerning the formation of a chapter at Troy State University School of Nursing. Since the nursing program was not accredited, the idea of forming a chapter was not pursued. During the spring of 1979, several junior nursing students petitioned the faculty to organize an honor society. Karen Allred, a student, contacted Headquarters for information about an honor society. In the fall, Jill Mayo and Janice Nelson, two faculty members that were Sigma Theta Tau members assisted the students with the development of an honor society. In January 1980, the students organized the honor society, and the organization grew, until the time in late 1985 the group petitioned Sigma Theta Tau International for a charter. With the 1985 induction ceremony, there were 138 new members inducted, along with the installation of new officers, and the transfer of membership by many members to the new chapter.

Sofie excels at illustration, typography, layout, and concept. At the end of last year, 2021, and the beginning of this year, 2022, Associate Professor Chris Stagl delivered a 3-week seminar to two of Troy University’s International partner schools, the University of Zaragoza in Spain, and Changzhou Institute of Technology in China. The opportunity stemmed from the desire to keep international experiences at the forefront of our Art & Design department even amid the pandemic. Professor Stagl modeled the program around the idea of an introductory typography course that he teaches here at TROY and worked one on one with students as they began to experiment and experience how we approach typography as design and communication in the states. Once the structure and projects of the seminar were developed, it was marketed to schools without a typography focus. The results were outstanding.

Scholarships,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: We encourage high school seniors to apply for the 4 Year Army ROTC National Scholarship at the start of their senior year. Please see our Resources page for more information. Newly enrolled Army ROTC cadets may also compete for campus based 2 and 3 year scholarships. These scholarships may be applied: The GRFD program is designed for cadets who are interested in obtaining a commission in the U.S. Army Reserves (USAR) or Army National Guard (ARNG) with a guarantee for a Reserve Component (RC) assignment. Scholarships cover full tuition and mandatory fees or room and board up to $10,000. Scholarship awardees also receive a book allowance and a monthly stipend based on their academic year. GRFD Cadets also receive weekend drill and annual training pay as participants in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) which means they will attend drill one weekend per month and a two week annual training with a RC unit. This scholarship offers 2, 3 or 4 year scholarships for qualified applicants. However, this is a dedicated reserve scholarship in the USAR or ARNG. This means the cadet will not be able to compete for active duty. You may be able to take advantage of a program that allows you to participate in ROTC and enlist in the ARNG or USAR at the same time, provided a vacancy exists in either a Guard or Reserve unit. It's called the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP), and it means that while you're still in college, you can be gaining valuable experience and earning extra income. In the SMP, you will be paid at the rate of at least a Sergeant E-5 for your Guard or Reserve service. In addition, you'll receive the ROTC Advanced Course allowance as well. You'll serve as an officer trainee in a Guard or Reserve unit and perform duties commensurate with the grade of second lieutenant. Once you graduate and receive your commission, you may continue your military service with a USAR or ARNG unit or go on active duty. The ROTC Contract that is agreed upon will determine a cadet status. You are considered Non-Deployable during your time as an SMP Cadet! The intent of the SMP Program is to increase officer accessions into the RC by increasing ROTC enrollment from enlisted RC members who are attending college. SMP cadets are paid for their RC training and receive the ROTC allowance as well as $1200.00 per year for books. Upon completing the ROTC program, the United States Army Officer agrees to an eight-year obligation, which can be served in the Reserve Forces, on Active Duty, or a combination of the two. All contracted Cadets receive a tax free monthly of $420 a month stipend during the school year. Troy University donates 15 room scholarships each semester to contracted Army ROTC Cadets. * Note: None of the listed programs include a meal plan.

Student Spotlight: Shay,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Shay with son, Luke, enjoying a hayride. (Photo from Shay's personal collection) Shay is a 33-year-old TROY Online student from south Alabama. She has been working as a radiologic technologist in hospitals and clinic settings for many years. Shay is also a single parent to a 7-year-old son. “I realized there is a difference between just making ends meet and making a life. I want the things all people desire to own my own home and to take my son on vacation things like that. I want to be able to provide for the unexpected things, like needing new tires on my car, without having to borrow money to do it. Something had to change and furthering my education seemed like the only way to make a positive turn.” Going back to school was a challenge while playing the busy roles of single mom and employee. “Being a single parent is hard. I am the only one here to get him ready for school, get him on the bus, pack his snack, pick him up in the afternoons, do spelling words, read stories, make sure he takes a bath, cook supper and make sure he eats it. There is no help with day-to-day things in a one-parent home and they are numerous, and unending but worth every minute.” Shay says that being a mom may be tough at times but it is her young son and family who keep her motivated. “I want to prosper and grow for my son. He deserves the best I can give him and I want him to see me working hard for my dreams. My degree will pay off for him one day too. “My mother is my support system. I watched her return to school as a single mom of two children and obtain her education. I know that, although it will be hard, it can be done.” TROY Online classes allow Shay the flexibility of growing her education during a very unpredictable time of life. “I am excited to be an online student at TROY. Online classes are a great benefit for me as a working adult. I never imagined I would be a single parent in college, but I have a secret weapon: knowledge that it can be done.”",https://www.troy.edu/online/student-spotlight-shay.html

University Statements,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Students, Faculty, and Staff, As a reminder, TROY currently has no special operational procedures or guidelines related to COVID-19 and continues to follow the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently, the CDC updated its guidance for how people can protect themselves and their communities from respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. The CDC now recommends treating COVID-19 the same as flu, RSV, and other respiratory viruses. According to the CDC, more than 98% of the U.S. population has some form of protection against the virus as a result of vaccinations or prior infection, resulting in a significant drop in COVID-related hospitalizations. Therefore, the CDC recommends that individuals who have contracted COVID-19 isolate from others for the duration of fever and other symptoms and may return to work or school after being symptom-free for 24 hours. Faculty members and students should follow their regular attendance policies as outlined in the course syllabus and treat COVID-19 as they would any other medical absence. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 are not required to complete a contact tracing worksheet and do not need a letter from Student Services to return to class or receive an excused absence. Quarantine is not required if a student or employee is exposed to someone with COVID-19 or any other contagious illness. Employees should use leave time for illnesses that render them unable to work or if they are caring for an ill family member. The health and well-being of the campus community remain our top concern, and our procedures will change as needed based on the latest state or federal guidance.Sincerely, Dr. Kerry PalmerSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Trojan Faculty, As we begin another academic year, I am grateful to you all for your professionalism and commitment to our students. Today, we are updating the University's coronavirus website with an important clarification regarding the procedure for student absences. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 are no longer required to complete a contact tracing worksheet and do not need a letter from Student Services in order to return to class or receive an excused absence. Cases of COVID-19 should be handled in the same manner as any infectious disease, such as flu. Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 should seek medical care and follow the guidance of their healthcare provider or the campus health center to determine when it is safe to return to campus. Faculty members should follow their regular attendance policies as outlined in the course syllabus and treat COVID-19 as they would any other medical absence. As a reminder, TROY currently has no special operational procedures or guidelines related to COVID-19. However, we are aware that COVID-19 remains a serious public health concern. The University continues to monitor cases on campus that are reported to the student health center and remains in close contact with the Alabama Department of Public Health. The health and well-being of everyone on campus is our top concern, and our procedures will change as needed based on the latest state or federal guidance. Sincerely, Dr. Kerry J. PalmerSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Colleagues, Thank you for all you have done to make the start of the new academic year a successful one. After the challenges of the past two years related to COVID-19, we are pleased that our students are once again able to enjoy a more normal college experience this fall.

Throughout this process, we have continually adjusted our plans based on the latest federal and state guidelines and the latest data from the community. Today, the COVID-19 situation is very different. We have been encouraged to see the decline in case numbers among our campus community. Therefore, our approach to the pandemic is evolving. Moving forward, there will be no special operational procedures or guidelines related to COVID-19 at any Troy University campus or location. We ask that individuals continue to be proactive about their health and safety and treat COVID-19 as you would any infectious disease.

Procedures for Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 or Exposure:If you are DIAGNOSED with COVID-19 Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (regardless of vaccination status) must isolate for at least 5 days. Following that, individuals may return to campus if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving (without fever for 24 hours) and should wear a mask when around others for the next 5 days. Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must notify the University using the COVID Contact Tracing Worksheet (Positive) in order to receive an excused absence. Employee absences related to a diagnosis of COVID-19 should be reported to human resources by supervisors. Individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 should notify their close contacts who may have been exposed. A person is considered to have been exposed if he or she has been within six feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes in the 48 hours prior to that person developing symptoms or testing positive (see CDC standard for “close contact”). If you have been EXPOSED to COVID-19 A person is considered to have been directly exposed if he or she has been within six feet of a person with a COVID-19 diagnosis for at least 15 minutes in the 48 hours prior to that person developing symptoms or testing positive (see CDC standard for “close contact”). Students, faculty or staff who are unvaccinated or more than 6 months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than 2 months after the J&J vaccine) and are not yet boosted, should quarantine for 5 days. Following that, individuals may return to campus if they have not developed symptoms, but should wear a mask when around others for the next 5 days. People who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. Students who need to quarantine due to exposure must notify the University by completing the COVID Contact Tracing Worksheet (Exposure) providing details about how they were exposed. There will be no excuse for the absences issued until this form has been completed. Employee absences related to COVID-19 exposure should be reported to human resources by supervisors. Quarantine/Isolation Procedures Where should I quarantine/isolate? If you need to quarantine or isolate due to exposure or a diagnosis of COVID-19, you must do so off campus or at your legal residence. Can I quarantine/isolate in my dorm if I live alone? You may quarantine in your dorm room only if you have a single-occupancy room— i.e., you do not share a bathroom or living space with any other student. If you choose to quarantine/isolate in your dorm, you must notify Student Services at covid19@troy.edu or (334) 670-3202 to receive meal delivery. 1. Masks/Face Coverings are optional inside Troy University buildings or facilities but are encouraged in any setting where social distance is difficult to maintain. Masks/Face Coverings remain mandatory on University Transit vehicles. In addition, faculty members may, at their discretion, REQUIRE masks/face coverings in the instructional settings to include: • Classrooms • Labs • Personal meetings between students and facultyFaculty may also retain a mask/face covering optional policy for their instructional spaces. Faculty expectations regarding masks/face coverings must be communicated to students in the class and updated in the online syllabus. 2. Vaccinations are strongly encouraged. All students, faculty and staff are urged to get a COVID-19 vaccination, either on the Troy Campus or through a health care provider of your choice. 3. Classrooms, offices and other facilities will operate at normal capacity. In addition to masks/face coverings, individuals are asked to be mindful of personal distance and observe social distance whenever possible indoors. 4. Maintain proactive personal health practices including washing hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces; refraining from touching your face; sneezing or coughing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow; and disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible. 5. Stay home when sick. Stay home if you are not feeling well, particularly if you are exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19 including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. (Students: See reporting procedures below for receiving an excused absence due to COVID-19 related absences.) Dear Trojans, In August, we announced a return to mandatory masks/face coverings inside Troy University buildings and facilities, with some exceptions. This move was made to protect the health and safety of the campus community in response to rising COVID-19 case numbers. In the weeks since, we have been pleased to see a steady decline in the number of cases being reported both on our campuses and in the surrounding communities. In Alabama, new cases have fallen by 61% in the last 14 days, and in Pike County new cases are down by 68% (per The New York Times). On the Troy Campus, we have been thrilled to see multiple days with no new cases reported among our students, faculty and staff. In addition, the number of individuals vaccinated at the University continues to grow. On the Troy Campus, 90% of faculty survey respondents have indicated they are vaccinated. In light of these falling case numbers, and after careful consideration, the University will begin gradually easing the mask requirement. Effective Monday, Oct. 18, masks/face coverings will be optional inside campus buildings and facilities. However, faculty members may, at their discretion, require masks/face coverings inside instructional spaces (i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) to include faculty offices. In addition, masks/face coverings will still be required on University Transit vehicles. Students must follow the mask guidelines established by their professors for classes, labs and office visits. Hallways, common areas and other indoor spaces will be mask/face covering optional. Students are still urged to be proactive about their personal health, and masks/face coverings are recommended in settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain, particularly for individuals with underlying health conditions or who have elected to remain unvaccinated. Other aspects of the safety plan remain unchanged. Stay home if you are sick, and report if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or must isolate due to exposure. The revised safety guidelines can be found online at troy.edu/coronavirus. The Coronavirus Task Force continues to meet regularly to discuss this ongoing situation. Watch your TROY email, University social media and the Coronavirus Information Center for the latest updates. Sincerely, The Coronavirus Task Force Dear Trojans, Last month, we announced a return to mask/face covering requirements for classrooms, labs, communal offices and other indoor spaces on campus. In the weeks since, we have been pleased to see a decline in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 on campus and a decline in the number of students out of class due to a COVID-19 diagnosis or exposure. In addition we continue to make progress in the number of faculty, staff and students who are getting vaccinated. Our goal this fall has been a return to a traditional campus experience while maintaining focus on the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff. Therefore, we will extend the mask through Oct. 15. The Coronavirus Task Force will evaluate the state of the campus over the coming weeks and issue additional guidance by that date. Reminder, under this guidance, masks/face coverings must be worn by all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, while indoors with some exceptions: Masks are ALWAYS required in the following settings: Masks/Face Coverings are NOT required in the following settings: For full details, the revised safety guidelines can be found online at troy.edu/coronavirus. The Coronavirus Task Force continues to meet regularly to discuss this ongoing situation. Watch your TROY email, University social media and the Coronavirus Information Center for the latest updates in the days ahead. Sincerely, The Coronavirus Task Force Dear Trojans, Our goal this fall has been a return to a traditional campus experience while maintaining focus on the health and safety of students, faculty and staff. Thus far we have been pleased with the results! 80% of our faculty-staff have reported they have received the vaccination and more than 800 students have already registered for the incentive program. When we announced our safety guidelines earlier this month, we committed to making necessary adjustments as the situation on campus evolved. Today, we are announcing important updates to our campus safety guidelines we hope will limit the spread of the coronavirus while allowing us to continue enjoying a traditional campus experience. Most significant is that masks/face coverings will be required in classrooms, labs, communal offices and other indoor spaces on campus starting Monday, Aug. 30, at 8 a.m. Masks/face coverings are not required outdoors, and there are several exceptions, including while eating in a dining facility, working out in the fitness center, or in your own dorm room. For full details, the revised safety guidelines are pasted below and can be found online at troy.edu/coronavirus. We expect masks/face coverings protocols will be temporary. The Coronavirus Task Force will evaluate the state of the campus over the coming weeks and issue guidance on Friday, Sept. 17 on whether protocols will be lifted or extended. We continue to urge everyone to get a COVID-19 vaccination, and the Troy Campus maintains an ample supply of vaccines. Please consider scheduling an appointment today. For students, there is an incentive program in place offering a number of prizes including scholarships and meal plans. The Coronavirus Task Force continues to meet regularly to discuss this ongoing situation. Watch your TROY email, University social media and the Coronavirus Information Center for the latest updates in the days ahead. Sincerely, The Coronavirus Task Force Dear Trojans, The start of the Fall Semester and Term 1 is just days away. The University is closely monitoring the increase in COVID-19 cases in our state and local community, and we are updating our COVID-19 guidelines to emphasize the actions we can all take to proactively protect ourselves and others from the coronavirus. The full guidelines are below and on our Coronavirus Information Center. However, I want to draw your attention to these key points: I want to thank each of you for your patience and cooperation as we have together successfully navigated uncertainty over the past year. The Coronavirus Task Force continues to meet regularly to discuss this ongoing situation. We will update our protocols as needed to protect the health and safety of our campuses. Watch your TROY email, University social media and the Coronavirus Information Center for the latest updates in the days ahead. Sincerely, Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force In accord with the latest guidance from the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control, Troy University is preparing to return to normal campus operations. Effective immediately, the TROY Strong COVID-19 protocols have been replaced by a new set of guidelines emphasizing personal responsibility and care for others. This transition plan (available on our Coronavirus Information Center) lifts many mandatory safety requirements, but still urges everyone on campus to protect the health and safety of their fellow Trojans through daily health practices. “All indices point to a lessening of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor. “Accordingly, effective immediately the University will replace institutional mandates with policies emphasizing personal responsibility regarding wearing masks, social distancing and personal hygiene. Our theme is ‘Have Fun in ‘21' and our goal is to return to regular operations. We will continue to monitor the impact of the virus, with the safety of students, faculty and staff as our main priority.” The new safety protocols are: “I am grateful to all of our students, faculty and staff for their diligence this past year in observing our COVID-19 safety procedures,” said Dr. Lance Tatum, Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. “Over the past few weeks, I have been encouraged by the declining numbers of COVID-19 cases on our Alabama campuses, including many days with no new cases reported at all. We feel now is the right time to begin our transition back to normal operations.” Students and employees are asked to continue reporting if they have been exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19, and the University will continue reporting confirmed cases on a weekly basis via the online Coronavirus Information Center. “We are still closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and will adjust our plans as needed to protect the health and safety of the campus, based on the latest state and federal guidance,” Dr. Tatum said. “In the meantime, I ask everyone to protect yourself and others by being mindful of daily health precautions.” TROY Community, At 5 p.m. on Friday, the State of Alabama moved to the new “Safer Apart” health order. Although this order no longer mandates the use of face coverings and social distancing, both are encouraged in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. To that end, I am asking that all members of the Troy University community continue following our TROY Strong safety protocols until the end of the spring semester. Our safety protocols have served us well since they were put in place last fall. With less than a month of classes to go, I urge you to remain committed to the personal health practices that we know make a difference in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. By working together, we can stay healthy, complete exams, and see a successful end to the semester. Following the spring semester, we will carefully consider what safety protocols are needed for the summer, based on the latest state and federal guidance. We remain committed to a return to regular operations this fall, including in-class instruction, campus events and full usage of campus facilities. In the meantime, I would urge all students, faculty and staff to get the COVID-19 vaccination, either at the Troy Campus or through a healthcare provider of your choice. Sincerely,Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force TROY Students, Gov. Kay Ivey announced today that starting April 5, all individuals age 16 and older will be eligible to receive the coronavirus vaccine under expanded guidelines from the Alabama Department of Public Health. I urge all Troy University students to take advantage of the opportunity to receive the vaccine at the Troy Campus health center. You may register starting today at covid.troy.edu or call 1-800-414-5756. Remember that you will need to return to the health center to get your second dose. To receive both doses on campus before the end of the spring semester, I encourage students to register as soon as possible. The vaccines remain available to members of the public as well, but note that TROY only has the Moderna vaccine, which has been approved ONLY for individuals age 18 and up. Troy University will continue to operate under the TROY Strong safety plan until the end of the spring semester. We continue to plan for a return to regular operations this fall, including in-class instruction, campus events and full usage of campus facilities. Having a significant percentage of our campus population vaccinated will be essential to helping us reach that goal. Sincerely,Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force TROY Community: The decline in COVID-19 cases nationally and in Alabama is an encouraging sign that the worst days of the pandemic may be behind us. Falling case numbers and the steady roll out of the vaccine, including the opening of our own vaccine clinic on the Troy Campus, gives us hope that we will see a return to normal operations on our campuses in the near future. With this in mind, I want to address what you can expect on our campuses for the rest of the spring and this fall. First, even though there are positive trends in the fight against COVID-19, we are committed to the safety measures put in place last fall. The TROY Strong procedures will remain in place at least until the end of the spring semester. To date, our safety plan has served us well, and I believe it is vital we remain committed to these procedures while more of the community and campus population is vaccinated. We are carefully considering what safety procedures will be in effect this summer and will make an announcement about that in the coming days. Next, we are preparing for a return to regular operations this fall, including in-class instruction, campus events and full usage of campus facilities. In fact, our expected theme for the fall will be to have “Fun in '21.” We know this goal is ambitious and dependent on many factors outside of our control. As always, our plans will follow the best guidance from state and federal officials, including the Alabama Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control. The current trends in case numbers give us hope, and our experiences last year tell us that now is the time to start planning for a return to normal operating models at all of our campuses in August. Our Coronavirus Taskforce has reviewed local and state data, including trend data for case counts, hospitalizations, and the number of vaccinations given in our service area. In Alabama, the seven-day average for new cases was 3,332 on Jan. 1 but had fallen to 575 by March 9. Hospitalizations have also fallen from a seven-day average of 2,586 to 659 over the same period, and more than 15% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. (All data from The New York Times.) All of this information suggests we are trending in a direction suitable for a return to regular operations in the fall. As we have stated in the past, our plans are subject to change as the situation evolves. If circumstances force a change in our direction, we will share the latest information with you via email, social media and the COVID-19 information website. For now, I ask that we all continue to focus on following safety protocols each day. Your commitment to being “TROY Strong” has helped keep our campuses and communities safe. Now, by working together, we can “Finish Strong,” and hopefully enjoy a traditional college experience on our campuses later this year. Sincerely,Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force TROY Faculty and Staff: I am pleased to announce that Troy University has partnered with the Alabama Department of Public Health to serve as a distribution center for COVID-19 vaccinations to faculty and staff and eligible members of the public starting this Thursday. Vaccines will be offered at the Health Center located next to the Trojan Center on the Troy Campus. TROY has received 2,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine, and we expect to receive up to 6,000 more over the coming weeks. Numerous TROY faculty, staff and students, particularly from the College of Health and Human Services, will be volunteering to help operate this vaccine center, and I want to thank them for their service. Through their efforts, TROY will play a key role in helping the vaccine reach the Wiregrass region. Distribution of the vaccine will strictly follow the guidelines determined by ADPH. Currently, those eligible to receive the vaccine include people age 65 and older along with: The ADPH Vaccine Allocation Plan is available online. Faculty and staff of the University are eligible to receive the vaccine under current ADPH guidelines. You can pre-register and be scheduled for an appointment by visiting covid.troy.edu or calling 1-800-414-5756. After receiving the first dose, a follow-up appointment will be made to receive the second part of the vaccination. I urge all of our faculty and staff to get the vaccination but doing so is not required by the University. You will be informed of any changes to the vaccine distribution plan via email, social media and the Coronavirus Information Center. Vaccine Registration Sincerely, Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force TROY Faculty and Staff: I am happy to report that we have received confirmation from the Alabama Department of Public Health that Troy University will begin receiving doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as early as next week. The quantity and date of arrival are still to be determined, but rest assured you will be notified as soon as those details are finalized. We have a distribution plan ready to take effect as soon as we receive the vaccine and are committed to administering doses within 24 hours of delivery. We will distribute from the health center on the Troy Campus, where there is ample refrigerated storage for our supply. Our distribution plan will follow ADPH guidelines to ensure people most at risk receive the vaccine first. Alabama is currently in phase 1B of the rollout, which includes people age 75 and older, health care personnel and first responders. You will receive additional information soon via email, social media and the Coronavirus Information Center, including how eligible faculty and staff can schedule a time to receive the vaccine. We are in contact with ADPH daily seeking the latest information, and we will remain proactive about securing the vaccine for our campus community. This is our highest priority as we seek to protect the health and safety of our community. Thank you all for your hard work and patience as we have adapted to the changes needed to operate during the global pandemic. Thanks to you, we've successfully resumed in-class instruction this spring, and I appreciate your commitment to our TROY Strong plan. Thank you for your patience. Sincerely,Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force To the TROY Community: I hope you all enjoy a happy holiday season and a well-deserved break after a challenging Fall Semester. We all had to adapt to new policies and procedures as a result of COVID-19, and I am grateful for your cooperation and patience. We were able to finish the Fall as we started — TROY Strong. Looking ahead to the Spring Semester, you can expect all of our COVID-19 safety protocols to remain in effect. Face coverings will still be required in all buildings, including all classrooms and office spaces; classrooms will be arranged for social distancing and large classes will be broken into “pods” that meet in alternating days; and student organizations will be expected to limit the size of events and practice safe social distancing at all times. For reference, TROY's full COVID-19 plan can be reviewed online at troy.edu/coronavirus. However, I want to draw attention to some key changes in regards to how cases of COVID-19 exposure are handled, based on the current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Alabama Department of Public Health: Finally, TROY will continue to participate in the State of Alabama's Sentinel Testing program for college campuses. Upon return in the spring, you may be selected for random COVID-19 testing, and we urge you to participate. This testing program is a vital tool for identifying cases on campus and ensuring the health and safety of the community. Thank you again for your hard work this fall. While at home, I would ask you all to be mindful of good health practices. Stay healthy, Trojans, and we will see you all again in January. Sincerely,Dr. Lance TatumSenior Vice Chancellor for Academic AffairsChair, Coronavirus Task Force TROY Students, We are approaching the end of a unique Fall Semester. Following the Thanksgiving break, the remaining coursework and final exams will be completed via Canvas. Although our campuses will remain open and residence halls, dining and other campus resources will be available, we know that many of you will choose to finish your classes at home. I want to thank all of you for working hard this semester to follow the TROY Strong safety plan. Those of you who were diligent in taking daily precautions, including wearing ",

Institutional Review Board FAQs,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: I've heard that the Federal regulations make certain categories of research exempt. If my research fits into one of these categories, does this mean that I don't have to have it reviewed by the IRB? What are the best practices for gender identification in research? I've heard that the Federal regulations make certain categories of research exempt. If my research fits into one of these categories, does this mean that I don't have to have it reviewed by the IRB? Yes, but it is not up to the investigator alone to determine if a protocol is exempt. Troy University has promised the Federal government that properly trained and designated faculty have the responsibility for determining whether or not a protocol is exempt. ""Exempt,"" as used here, means that it is exempt from a review by the IRB. The IRB Chair will determine whether a study is Exempt from review. It does not mean that the research need not be reviewed and approved before data collection can begin. Fill out and submit an Application form for EVERY study that deals with human subjects. Can I recruit students from my own classes to participate in my research? If you are the instructor or teaching assistant, or anyone the students would see as having power and authority over them, then the answer is generally ""no."" This is because the students could perceive the situation as one in which they really cannot refuse, even if they really did not want to be in your study. You must avoid even the perception of coercion. If your students have special skills that make them particularly valuable as potential research participants, the IRB may approve your request to use them provided that you structure your protocol in such a way that the coercive potential is eliminated. If my research protocol is only for an undergraduate class, does it have to have IRB approval? Not if it qualifies for an Exemption. If your research falls into a category that can be exempt from IRB review, your course instruction should be able to certify this exemption. Is it true that I need IRB review even if I am not doing an experiment, but I am only conducting interviews, surveys, or simply observing people? It depends. As long as your research involves living human beings If your research falls into a category that qualifies for an exemption from review, your supervisor should be able to certify this exemption. If your research falls outside this category, you need to have it reviewed by the IRB. Under no circumstances may Principal Investigators make the decision to exempt their studies from review. If I am based at the Phenix City Campus, Montgomery Campus, Dothan Campus, or a TROY Global Campus site do I still need to get approval from you? Yes. You need to get approval from this IRB before you can conduct research at ANY TROY site. A representative from each site has been appointed to the IRB. How long will it take for me to obtain approval to do my study? It depends on the nature of your study and the characteristics of the people you intend to recruit. Allow 4-6 weeks for studies that, in the judgment of the IRB, involve more than minimal risk to the participants, because your protocol will need to be reviewed at a monthly IRB meeting. If the IRB needs you to make extensive changes in your protocol and tables further discussion of it for the next meeting, then clearly the time could be longer. Most protocols that come to this IRB, however, are of such a nature that they need not be reviewed at a convened meeting. How will I know when my protocol is approved? You will receive notification by email and by letter at the addresses that you provide when you submit your protocol to the IRB. Do I always have to obtain informed consent? There are limited exceptions. The IRB has the authority to waive the Federal requirements for informed consent in certain circumstances, such as when obtaining consent would not be practical. For example, observational studies of public behavior would not require informed consent of the people you observe. Do research participants always have to sign an informed consent? No. There are several research situations, all involving no more than minimal risk, where the IRB can authorize you to obtain consent orally. For example, if your participants cannot write, the IRB will waive this requirement, provided that the study presents no more than minimal risk. Otherwise, you would have to obtain written consent from someone authorized to act on behalf of the participant. As another example, if the risk to your participants would increase markedly because they signed a consent form (as in an interview or survey that addressed the participant's HIV status), then the requirement could also be waived. You would still need to obtain informed consent, but it could be obtained orally. What do you mean by ""child assent script""? When you intend to collect data from children who are capable of comprehending, after obtaining consent from one or both of their parents, you must tell the children what to expect if they agree to participate in your research. You must make as certain as possible that the child understands that he or she has a free choice in the matter. The words that you use to present your study to the children are your ""script."" The children must give you a positive affirmation of their interest in participating. This is their way of exhibiting ""assent."" How do I get to do research in the public school system? First, contact the appropriate school officials (Director of Research in most public school systems, or individual principals in private schools) about access to their students or teachers. Ask them to send you a letter of support for your research. Then you obtain IRB approval for your research. Attach the letter of support to your application. My research will be done in another country. Do I have to obtain IRB review and approval? Yes. Moreover, you may also need to provide the university (through the IRB) that you have authorization from the officials in that country to conduct your protocol there. After I download the IRB form from the Internet and complete it, can I send it back to you by email? Yes. You MUST email the form and other necessary documents. However, you will also have to fax or send the original form with official signatures. May I get feedback on my application before I make hard copies to send to you? Yes. You may email questions or a draft of your application to your College or Site representative. You may also call your College or Site representative with any questions you may have. See the Committee Members list to find your College or Site representative. Will the Institutional Review Board operate during the Summer semesters? No. Institutional Review Board members may not be on campus during the Summer semesters. If you wish to undertake research during the summer, you must have it approved before the end of the Spring semester. See the Meeting Schedule for submission deadlines and meeting dates. Can I use social media in my research? When considering using social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) as a recruitment tool for collecting participants, please read the article below as tool for guidance.

Chemistry,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Chemistry is the study of the properties and behavior of atoms and molecules. The world around us is composed of matter, and chemistry explains the composition of matter, its transformations, and the energies that are associated with these transformations. Chemists seek to understand and use matter in ways that benefit society. Many of the modern-day, and day-to-day items like plastics, medicine, fuel, food, soap, fertilizers, and even some of the electronic components of a computer are developed by chemists who have pioneered exploration of the unknown and have continuously pushed the boundary of knowledge. Chemistry is the central science, connecting disciplines like physics, biology, geology, agriculture, pharmacy, material science and engineering. Students studying chemistry at Troy University will receive training in the theoretical underpinnings of the subject as well as hands-on experience in laboratory skills. The small class sizes allow faculty members and students to interact frequently and on personal levels. The faculty in chemistry routinely offer research experiences to students in areas such as organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, computational chemistry, biochemistry, and drug discovery. Our chemistry majors and minors find diverse career opportunities in academia, industry, and government. In recent years, many of our chemistry major graduates have continued their studies, primarily but not exclusively, in graduate programs across the country and have eventually found research positions. Some graduates in chemistry have taken additional courses in secondary education to pursue a career in teaching in the high school system. Other graduates have procured positions in private industry and the government in which their knowledge of chemistry, laboratory skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are valued.

What can affect my results,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The University can accept undergraduate courses completed at regionally accredited institutions of higher learning. The University can accept ACE recommended credits for military or civilian workforce experiences as listed in the National Guide, National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS), Joint Services Transcript (JST), etc. Developmental or remedial courses do not transfer, with the exception of select remedial math courses that are posted for prerequisite purposes only. The credits will not be used toward total degree hours. Technical and/or vocational courses do not transfer, unless taken as part of a regionally accredited associate's degree and deemed appropriate for transfer. Continuing education unit (CEU) courses do not transfer. Credits from institutions that operate on the quarter system will be converted to semester hours. This is done by multiplying the quarter credit hours by 2/3 or by dividing the number of quarter hours by 1.5. Quarter Hours Semester Hours1 .66662 1.33333 24 2.66665 3.3333 Grades of Pass/Satisfactory at the undergraduate level are acceptable as long as the credit is equivalent to a C grade or better. Each college determines how courses will be applied to meet general education and program requirements. A course that is determined to fulfill a general education area at one institution may not be acceptable as a TROY general studies requirement. In addition, for a transfer course to be awarded as a TROY science course it must have a laboratory component. Equivalent science courses without a verified lab component will be applied to the lecture course only until the lab can be verified. Credit from community colleges is considered to be lower level and is generally applicable only to freshman (1100-level) and sophomore (2200-level) requirements. Some select 3300-level awards are allowed as approved by the departments. Additional documentation may be required (e.g., syllabus or course descriptions) if further review of a course equivalency is desired. Once this course-by-course credit evaluation is completed an academic program evaluation can be performed to determine what courses will be for a declared major/program/minor combination. A student should check with his/her academic advisor on how to obtain an 'Official' Academic Program Evaluation, which is a separate process from the transfer credit evaluation, or an online request can be made at the Registrar's Request for Official Academic Evaluation AND/OR Change of Major form.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/academic-resources/records-office/academic-evaluation-center/results.html

FALL 2018 AND SPRING 2019 EMPLOYER SURVEY REPORT100% of the Troy University New Hires were Moderately Well to Extremely Well prepared to impact P-12 Student Learning. 2018-2019 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENTTROY graduates are very well prepared coming out of college. Evaluations conducted by administrators utilizing a proprietary protocol were not obtained this year. Administrators did not want to share due to the pandemic. Even though evaluations were completed in the Fall of 2019, prior to the pandemic, the employers opted out of this data collection. A plan was developed to contact employers twice a year (Fall and Spring) to collect evaluation data. Since we will not have any evaluations from this year, we will post data from the evaluations completed in the 2020-2021 school year in Spring of 2022. Additional supporting data to show indicators of teaching effectiveness Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 EMPLOYER SURVEYS combined scores indicate: 2020 Educator Preparation Institutional Report Card for Performance on Required Content Knowledge and Pedagogy Tests and Responses to the First-Year Teacher Survey created by the Alabama Association of Colleges for Teacher Education for Troy University.

Of the 13 items from this survey that align to the EPP developed employer and completers surveys, the responses indicate impact on P-12 student learning. Employers scored TROY completers in a range of 7-25 percentage points ABOVE the state average with an overall average of scores in the Teacher Leader-Effective range at 78.9% compared to state-wide completers at 59%. No scores were below the state average. Over the three year period that this report card has been provided, this survey shows the highest scores TROY completers earned and are extremely favorably in comparison with other EPPs in the state. We will still display the 2018-2019 data until the new cycle of data can be collected, analyzed, and displayed. Evaluations were conducted by administrators utilizing a state approved proprietary protocol. While the observation tool language indicates student behavior, the EPP asserts that these student behaviors are the result of teacher behaviors that influence P-12 learning. Each category has multiple subsections. Observations are scored from 0 (not evident) to 4 (very evident). Teacher Observation Elementary Teachers High SchoolTeachers Total Average B. High Expectations Teachers observed by in this data collection demonstrate effective learning environments. Although digital learning is scored as somewhat evident, teachers may not have been using technology during the observed lesson.

John Baum,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: I was only 5 years old when Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her seat on the bus. I have no real recollection of that event or the boycott which followed. I do recall, however, as a young boy, going to the Empire Theatre, which was an all-white theatre. Today, the Rosa Parks Museum now stands where that theatre was located. When Sylvia and Charles graduated from Sidney Lanier H.S., it was all white. By the time I graduated, it was integrated. In this audience today, are several African-American men and white Jewish men, all from Baltimore, who are members a group, known as the HeBros. Charles loved being a member of the HeBros. The group was formed for the purpose of fostering camaraderie among African American and Jewish men, who meet to discuss politics and civil rights, all the while making an attempt at playing golf. In the audience is a black woman, originally from California, who was determined to be here today, and on her way, was particularly determined to visit the Tuskegee Airman National Historic Park,…, to stand on the site where her father trained as a WW II pilot. Also, in the audience is a white man from Baltimore, who devoted his career to being a civil rights attorney, and has recently published a book about the plight of African Americans on the Eastern Shore of Maryland faced with segregation, Jim Crow laws and lynchings. And the reason all of us are here today, some 60 years after a black woman refused to give up her seat to a white man,… is that a white woman made a very generous gift to the Museum, which honors the courage and deeds of that black woman…. And this Museum is recognizing that gift by naming its Atrium in the memory of a white man… All of this is to say, that the arc of the moral universe, which Martin Luther King spoke about, is, indeed, long,…. but it does bend towards justice and equality. Sometimes it does not bend as quickly as we would like, but the presence of all of us here today is a vivid demonstration that the arc does continue to bend in the right direction. Rosa Parks once remarked: “Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others.” There is no better illustration of remembering Charles’ life and his good deeds, than Patti’s gift to the Rosa Parks Museum. On behalf of our extended family, Patti, I want to thank you for what this means to us. First and foremost, Charles would be immensely pleased and proud to have the Atrium named in his memory. He also would be very happy that Patti’s gift will be used to fund camp activities for children, so they can learn more about the civil rights mission, and about Rosa Parks and other civil rights leaders. Charles’ lifetime connection to Montgomery and his commitment to social justice and civil rights make the gift to this place especially fitting. Our Mother and Father would also be very proud to have our family name associated with the Rosa Parks Museum. Our parents lived their entire lives here; they were well known for their participation in various community and charitable activities. Charles was proud of his Alabama roots, and his connection with Montgomery was maintained over the years through numerous visits with Jane, Katie, Matt and Deb, Patti, Staci and Andy, Beth and Dan, and also, of course with Bea and Max. (Charles, and all of us, loved the fact that there is another Max Baum…) And that is another reason to thank Patti for her very thoughtful and meaningful gift. Her actions have, literally, produced a pilgrimage to Montgomery this weekend. I look out and see scores of out of town friends and family. I also see dozens of Charles’ Montgomery friends with whom he maintained close contact throughout his lifetime. There are three Baum family generations here, and it is especially heartwarming to see so many members of the third generation. For many of this youngest generation, this is their initial visit to Montgomery, and has been a wonderful opportunity for them to meet and play together for the first time. Included in this third generation is our grandson, Alex, whose 3rd birthday happens to be today. Also, our granddaughter, Charlotte, who was named for Charles… So, Patti, we had much to be thankful for, when Charles brought you into his life and into our family, and now we are so very grateful for what you have done to maintain Charles’ legacy, here, in our hometown.",https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/about/charles-cahn-baum-family-atrium/john-baum.html

Southern Association of Colleges and School Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC),"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges is the regional body for the accreditation of degree-granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. The Commission's mission is the enhancement of educational quality throughout the region and the improvement of the effectiveness of institutions by ensuring that they meet standards established by the higher education community that address the needs of society and students. It serves as the common denominator of shared values and practices among the diverse institutions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Latin America, and other international sites approved by the Commission on Colleges that award associate, baccalaureate, master's, or doctoral degrees. The Commission also accepts applications from other international institutions of higher education. Accreditation by SACS Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) signifies that the institution (1) has a mission appropriate to higher education, (2) has resources, programs, and services sufficient to accomplish and sustain that mission, and (3) maintains clearly specified educational objectives that are consistent with its mission and appropriate to the degrees it offers, and that indicate whether it is successful in achieving its stated objectives. Self-regulation through accreditation embodies a traditional U.S. philosophy that a free people can and ought to govern themselves through a representative, flexible, and responsive system. Accordingly, accreditation is best accomplished through a voluntary association of educational institutions. Both a process and a product, accreditation relies on integrity, thoughtful and principled judgment, rigorous application of requirements, and a context of trust. The process provides an assessment of an institution's effectiveness in the fulfillment of its mission, its compliance with the requirements of its accrediting association, and its continuing efforts to enhance the quality of student learning and its programs and services. Based upon reasoned judgment, the process stimulates evaluation and improvement, while providing a means of continuing accountability to constituents and the public. The product of accreditation is a public statement of an institution's continuing capacity to provide effective programs and services based on agreed upon requirements. The statement of an institution's accreditation status with the Commission on Colleges is also an affirmation of an institution's continuing commitment to the Commission's principles and philosophy of accreditation. The Commission on Colleges expects institutions to dedicate themselves to enhancing the quality of their programs and services within the context of their resources and capacities and to create an environment in which teaching, public service, research, and learning occur, as appropriate to the mission. At the heart of the Commission's philosophy of accreditation, the concept of quality enhancement presumes each member institution to be engaged in an ongoing program of improvement and be able to demonstrate how well it fulfills its stated mission. Although evaluation of an institution's educational quality and its effectiveness in achieving its mission is a difficult task requiring careful analysis and professional judgment, an institution is expected to document the quality and effectiveness of all its programs and services. The Commission on Colleges supports the right of an institution to pursue its established educational mission; the right of faculty members to teach, investigate, and publish freely; and the right of students to access opportunities for learning and for the open exchange of ideas. However, the exercise of these rights should not interfere with the overriding obligation of an institution to offer its students a sound education. 3.3.1 The institution identifies expected outcomes, assesses the extent to which it achieves these outcomes, and provides evidence of improvement based on analysis of the results in each of the following areas: (Institutional Effectiveness) 3.3.1.1 educational programs, to include student learning outcomes",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/education/about-college/accreditation/sacs-coc.html

World Premiere of the 2022 Film Camp Intensive Student-Short Film, ""SHORTCUT"" Starring, Produced, Edited, and Directed By:Brandon Beachboard, Brandon Underwood, Collin Hardin, Rory Stagner, Henry Gillam and Introducing Nate & Howie. Faculty AdvisorChris Stagl SynopsisA young man, Thomas, finds himself at a crossroad of running late to school or taking the terrifying shortcut through the forest. One Sheet Poster Options For one week this past July, five students from various Alabama high schools and two Troy University Graphic Design students came together to create a short film titled, “SHORTCUT”, during the annual Summer Spotlight Intensive hosted by the Department of Theatre and Dance. Less than one month later, “SHORTCUT” has been chosen as an official selection to The Student World Impact Film Festival (SWIFF) - the premier student film festival that attracts submissions from 5,000+ aspiring filmmakers in over 100 countries each year. “Working on SHORTCUT was not only a fun experience but I worked with people who have forever changed my life and getting accepted into SWIFF is only the icing on the cake for me”, said Collin Hardin, actor and crew on the film. “It is crazy to me how our little murder film was able to make it this far,” said Rory Stagner, actress and animator on the film. “So many people love SHORTCUT, and it is wonderful to see that people enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it. I’m so happy that our hard work paid off, and I’m excited to see our film in the SWIFF festival!” “Making “Shortcut” was an amazing time and I am so happy that I had the chance to work on this and so glad that it will be shown to people everywhere,” said Henry Gillam, cast and crew. “One of my favorite memories from this film is easily the late-night editing,” said Nathan Hobbs, actor and crew. “Watching it unfold in front of our eyes really made it worth the long, hot, and stressful days. So happy that we had a crew that was willing to play around with different ideas and really make something special.” “The opportunity to work with other like-minded artists is something indie filmmakers our age don’t get to experience,” said Brandon Underwood, actor and crew member. “Through this camp we got to experience that opportunity and see the awesome results of our work.” The film camp is a new addition to the Summer Spotlight lineup and was hosted by Design Professor, Chris Stagl. “This has been an amazing opportunity to work with students from all over the state, including two of our own design students, and see this project come together,” Stagl stated. “I gave some general directions, thoughts, and ideas they could try but ultimately, the students created this entire project on their own – they deserve every bit of the credit and kudos. I cannot believe they got their film into an International Festival so quickly – just goes to show the hard work they put in paid off!”",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-communication-fine-arts/departments/art-design/summer-spotlight.html

ADA Policy,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Approved October 21, 2003 Contact Information Click here to download a printable PDF version of this form that contains the Application for Disability Services and related forms. Online Content Accessibility Issue Report Transcription Requests It is the policy of Troy University to provide accessible programs, services, activities, reasonable accommodations, and a harassment-free environment, for any student or employee with a documented disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Troy University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, race, national origin, religion, or handicap in its admissions, education, employment, or access to its programs. Troy University complies with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; Federal Executive Order 11246; Educational Amendments of 1972 and 1974; the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1972; Age Discrimination Act of 1975; and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Troy University Disability Coordinators and Directors of Human Resources are committed to ensuring that all information regarding students and employees is maintained as confidential as required or as permitted by law. Disability information collected for the benefit of any student does not become part of the student’s academic record, nor does disability information collected for the benefit of the employee become a part of any public document. Information in files will not be released without a student’s or employee’s written permission except in circumstances mandated by federal or state law. On July 26, 1990, President George Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) into law. The ADA is built upon the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), which calls for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Troy University is committed to preventing discrimination against persons with disabilities by being proactive in complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Troy University is covered under both Title I (Employment) and Title II (State and Local Government) of the ADA. The ADA covers all programs and activities conducted by the University and extends federal civil rights protection to persons with a disability. ADA mandates that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity”. Troy University, under the guidelines of ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, is required to make reasonable accommodations for documented physical and mental limitations of otherwise-qualified individuals with disabilities. To provide the best possible services to students, employees, and visitors, Troy University has designated the Disability Services Coordinator and Director of Human Resources on each campus the responsible parties for coordinating accommodations for persons with disabilities. For more information about physical access to building or grounds, academic or workplace accommodations, or other ADA related services individuals should contact the Disability Services Coordinator or Director of Human Resources on the specific campus. Every event, special activity, and program hosted or planned by the University should be accessible to persons with disabilities. When selecting a location for an event, consideration should be given to its accessibility. If the event is publicized, provide persons with disabilities the opportunity to request special accommodations. Special accommodations can include alternate printed materials, interpreters for the deaf, assistive listening devices, etc. To determine the special accommodations that may be requested, list the following statement on all applications, registration, and program announcements: Individuals with disabilities requiring special accommodations should contact ____________ (event coordinator) prior to the event, allowing reasonable advanced notice so that reasonable accommodations may be arranged. 7.1 Students Unlike the K-12 system, in higher education it is the responsibility of the student to self-identify as being in need of accommodation. This means it is the student’s responsibility to make application to be accepted as a student with a disability, provide documentation, cooperate with the Disability Services Coordinator to determine appropriate accommodations, deliver Accommodation Letters to the faculty, etc. In other words, students with disabilities in higher education (just as those without disabilities) are expected to take an active role in managing all aspects of their academic needs, adhere to academic policies and deadlines and follow codes of conduct. 7.2 Employees The employee must satisfy the requirements for the job, such as education, employment experience, skills, certificates, or licenses. The employee must also be able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. Employees who believe they have a disability are responsible for notifying their supervisors, contacting the Director of Human Resources and/or the Disability Services Coordinator, and following the procedures outlined in this policy to secure reasonable accommodation. 7.3 Faculty Faculty are not responsible for, nor should they become involved in, evaluating a student’s disability or reviewing documentation of claimed disabilities. Faculty who are presented with such requests are responsible for referring the student to the Disability Services Coordinator. The Disability Services Coordinator will evaluate the request in accordance with established policy (see App. A) and make appropriate determinations. If accommodations are merited, a student will present the faculty with an Accommodation Letter. The Accommodation Letter, signed by the Disability Services Coordinator, verifies that the student is registered as a student with a disability and entitled to the accommodations specified on the letter. Faculty are responsible for reviewing the information in the letter and discussing how the accommodation will be implemented in the course. Any questions or concerns about the information contained in the letter should be directed to the Disability Services Coordinator. Faculty utilizing Distance Learning media are responsible for ensuring that students with disabilities have full access to distance learning course materials just as they are for students in the classroom. Examples include: ensuring fully accessible websites, use of captioned media, and/or providing written transcripts of video presentations. Since the possibilities in Distance Learning are endless, the means of providing accommodations must remain open to creativity. Each situation should be evaluated on a case-by- case basis, and accommodations made that are reasonable for each situation. Distance Learning faculty are responsible for contacting the Disability Services Coordinator with questions concerning the implementation of accommodations. Reasonable accommodation in the classroom (traditional, virtual, or otherwise) is an individual civil right guaranteed by federal legislation (ADA and Section 504). Reasonable accommodations are not optional and must be provided. Faculty who refuse reasonable accommodations may be held personally liable for their actions. However, there may be options regarding provision of the accommodations. Most course or classroom accommodations are easily arranged and the Disability Services Coordinator stands ready to assist. When questions arise as to a specific accommodation, it is the responsibility of the faculty to contact the Disability Services Coordinator to resolve the matter. Faculty should not offer accommodations without following proper procedures, as this could risk setting a precedent that may not be appropriate or maintainable by the University. All faculty are responsible for including the following statement in each course syllabus:(See Section 3.8.2.8 of the Faculty Handbook.) AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT: 7.4 Supervisors Personnel serving in supervisory positions are responsible for referring employees needing accommodation to the Director of Human Resources and/or Disability Services Coordinator. It is the responsibility of the Director of Human Resources, in consultation with the Disability Services Coordinator, to evaluate whether or not an employee has a disability covered by the ADA and to determine appropriate accommodations. If accommodations are merited, the Director Human Resources will notify the employee and the supervisor in writing using The Disability Services Accommodation Letter (see App. B). Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the information in the letter and discussing with the employee how the accommodations will be integrated into duties. The Disability Services Coordinator and the Director of Human Resources are available to assist the supervisor in determining how best to implement reasonable accommodations. Supervisors should not offer accommodations to employees who have not followed established policies for obtaining assistance. Supervisors remain responsible for evaluating whether or not an employee is able to perform his or her job (given reasonable accommodation) just as the supervisor would for any other employee under his/her supervision. Reasonable accommodation in the workplace is an individual civil right guaranteed by federal legislation (ADA and Section 504). Reasonable accommodations are not optional and must be provided. Supervisors who refuse reasonable accommodations may be held personally liable for their actions. However, there may be options regarding the provision of the accommodations. Most workplace accommodations are easily arranged and the Disability Services Coordinator and Director of Human Resources stand ready to assist. When questions arise as to a specific accommodation, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to contact the Director of Human Resources or Disability Services Coordinator to resolve the matter. NOTE: The policies and procedures set forth in this document will be periodically reviewed and revised to reflect compliance with existing legislation, amendments to current statutes, or enactment of additional statutes. Each such revision shall supersede, as does this document, all previous publications, or excerpts published or cited elsewhere. Based upon Guidelines from The Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of l973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 state that qualified students/employees with disabilities who meet the admission, academic or employment standards of Troy University are entitled to reasonable accommodations. Under these laws, a disability is defined as any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Having a history of impairment, or being perceived as having impairment may also qualify one as an individual with a disability. It is the student’s/employee’s responsibility to disclose his/her needs and provide appropriate documentation to the Disability Services Coordinator / Director of Human Resources on the respective campus. Appropriate documentation is defined as follows: Health Condition, Mobility, Hearing, Speech, or Visual ImpairmentA letter or report from the treating physician, orthopedic specialist, audiologist, otologist, speech pathologist, ophthalmologist, optometrist (as appropriate) which includes: Psychological DisorderA letter or report from a mental health professional who is impartial and not related to the student/employee, i.e., psychiatrist, psychologist, neuropsychologist, licensed professional counselor, or clinical social worker which includes: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)A comprehensive evaluation by a physician, neurologist, licensed clinical, rehabilitation or school psychologist, neuropsychologist, or psychiatrist which includes: Learning Disabilities (LD)A comprehensive evaluation report written in narrative form by an impartial individual not related to the student/employee, i.e., licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, learning disabilities specialist, licensed professional counselor, educational therapist or diagnostician, which includes: Note: High School IEP, 504 Plan, and/or letter from a physician or other professional will not be sufficient to document a learning disability.

Organizational Leadership Courses (LDR),"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: This course provides doctoral students with an opportunity to examine globalization from the view-point of organizational leadership. Students develop a global perspective and develop their focus a focus from an organizational perspective as a leader who promotes a global perspective among colleagues. Specifically, this course examines organizational leadership from the changing context of globalization. This course examines advanced definitions and determinations of staffing needs, supervision, and management and coordination problems, which include methods in supervision, mentoring, and coaching. These methods focus on but are not limited to policies and practices relating to the functions of employee engagement concerning recruitment, selection, assignment, salary planning, scheduling, promotion, separation, grievances, reassignment, records, development programs, in-service training, evaluation, benefits and services. We recognize on some fundamental level that we shape and are shaped by self and organizations. The purpose in this course is to bring greater skilled application and meaning-making to the increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world of organizational life as applied to organizational environments. Part one of the course involves setting the foundation and framing concepts of change along with an individual visit to a student selected organization and interview of someone in a leadership role. In Part two of the course, begins with a process of exploring what change means within ourselves at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. The focus will then go on to the study of classic theories and progress to the critical analysis of emerging models. We will work to understand what brings (and does not bring) sustainable change to self, others, and organizations and how different leadership models can be applied to this learning. The second part of this class concludes with resistance and immunity to change and applying what we have learned to our own environment. Part three of the course begins with a follow-up visit to the same organization for a second interview of that same person in a leadership role. The second visit, interview and engagement are a metaphor in how we reframe and re-look learning, assumptions, blind spots, challenges, and resistance from the beginning of the course. The final class culminates with a student-led Socratic final exam. Mastery of theoretical constructs, best practice models, and in a nested systemic analysis applied to leaders and organizations will be required of all students to be successful in the course. Collectively, the readings, class experiences, and interviews become an integrative understanding of change and are presented in a final presentation of individual and organizational change recommendations. Our effort is to consider the process of and resistance to change, from the intra-personal to the Eco global levels, that is essential to prepare ourselves to lead in the world of now as well as in the rapidly approaching future that awaits us all. This course examines the major conceptual frameworks for understanding human behavior within organizations, the competencies required for effective leadership and the major functions of human resource development as an integral part of overall management as applied to organizations. This course is designed both for current and aspiring global leaders. It is designed to examine the role of global leaders in emerging social, economic, and political contexts that are changing the nature of education, altering how educational organizations are viewed, and are transforming how they are led. A broad range of planning and management issues relating to groups and teams within organizations will be explored that are critical to the success of global leaders and issues that can affect relationships and impact global organizations. Particular attention will be paid to issues of management in diverse organizations and across countries and regions in the global environment. This course is an advanced seminar in organizational leadership that addresses individual and global issues. Students form an organization in the class and take on roles of key stakeholders based on personal interests and inter-group requirements. Each group or division of students will appropriately organize to achieve divisional and organizational goals decided upon in the first and/or second class session. Students develop a focus from an organizational perspective as a leader who promotes a global perspective among colleagues.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS),"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Classes | Cost | Registration Why an online certificate course in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)? GIS are revolutionizing the way we do business, the way we govern, and the way we live. GIS is a tool that allows end users, analysts, and decision makers to visualize data in several different ways in order to see patterns and relationships in a given area or subject. These patterns generally appear on 2D maps, 3D maps, or animated 4D maps. They can also be found on globes or in reports and charts. GIS is a computer hardware and software system that is used to store, display, analyze, and map information. Geographers, planners, land developers, real estate agents, utility companies, and municipal officials all use these systems. In fact, modern planning cannot move forward without these systems and those trained to run them. For example, a local government might use a GIS to evaluate alternative locations for roads, landfills, or other facilities. Using the GIS, such topics as population distribution, traffic movement, land availability, real estate prices, environmental hazards, soil types, utility inventory, sustainability mapping, site suitability, flood zones, and many more, could be analyzed together to help the decision makers make an informed choice. Jobs are available for those who like to work with computers and understand the importance of information retrieval. According to Salaries.com a GIS Analyst I in the United States is expected to make $41,709 and above. Some of the job position titles are: GIS Analyst I, Entry Level GIS Analyst, Level I GIS Analyst, and Level I Geographic Information Systems Analyst. There are a variety of ways to get started learning GIS. You may be employed in a non-GIS field and are learning GIS as part of your job. Maybe you are switching careers or retraining yourself to find a new job in the growing GIS industry. Perhaps you are a student who wants to earn a GIS certificate to support your field of study with aspirations of landing a job doing GIS. The opportunities are unlimited!!!

Inviting volunteers from the Follow-Up Survey for Graduates and from one large size school system, we were able to collect progress monitoring achievement data from three programs: Early Childhood, Elementary and Special Education/Collaboration K-6. This was existing data in the school systems. Middle and high school systems do not implement the progress monitoring software. For the next year middle and high school completers will administer pre- and post-test tests to provide student learning data. Progress monitoring data shows percentage of students in the different levels of achievement. Some end-of-the-year data have higher number of students than the beginning of the year data due to new students enrolled in the school and classes. Although there are students still in Level I, these students may have increased their scores but not enough to move to Level II. Students took the assessment at the beginning of the school year and then took an end of the year assessment. Charts show the percentage of students scoring at each level of 1- lowest to 5-highest and exceed expectations. For each year, the teachers have moved increased student learning by moving them to the next level. While some of the lowest levels still contain student numbers, these students may have increased their learning even by a few points. The 5 levels are categorized as These percentiles are national percentiles comparing the students to their peers across the nation. During and coming out of the pandemic we know that student scores have decreased overall. All schools across the nation have expressed concern about the loss of learning. This chart with shows completers decreased the percentage of students in the lower levels (1, 2) and increased the percentage of students in higher levels (3, 4, 5), demonstrating a positive impact on P-12 learning during the 2021-2022 school year.

Slightly over half of the students scored average or above at the beginning of the year and the number increased by the end of the year to 63.2% 38.3% of students were below average at the beginning of the school year. By the end of the school year the number decreased to 30%. 61.7% of the students scored average or above at the beginning of the year and the number increased by the end of the year to 70%. 62.1% of students were below average at the beginning of the school year. By the end of the school year the number decreased to 60.2%. 37.9% of the students scored average or above at the beginning of the year and the number increased by the end of the year to 39.8%. For the 2022-2023 school year we have increased collection of data from one to three school systems to collect data not only from their progress monitoring software but to include pre- and post-test data from all programs. These pre- and post -tests will be developed by the completers and used in grades and subjects in which the progress monitoring assessments are not administered. Focus Group Interview Four individuals agreed to participate, one ELE major, two Collab K-6 majors and one double major of Collab K-6 and ELE. Although this is a very small group and does not represent all programs, it provided a deeper understanding of the impact completers have on P-12 student-learning growth. These completers were candid, providing suggestions to improve the program and commending faculty and instructional practices that helped them to positively impact student learning. However, when they were asked how they know they have a positive impact on P-12 student learning, they provided anecdotal stories of learning growth for specific students who were below grade level and how they made great gains to reach benchmark or almost reaching benchmark. They also indicated that the scores on their progress monitoring tests show students have increased in learning, even if by 2 points, which showed growth in student learning. These interviewees agreed to send progress monitoring data before the end of school. 73.91% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded believe Very Well to Extremely Well that they are prepared to impact P-12 student learning. This has increased significantly from the previous year, but did not meet benchmark. It may be due to the pandemic with schools changing from in-person to virtual to blended multiple times throughout the school year. As we look over time, responses from After reviewing the data from previous surveys and the survey for the current year, data shows the pandemic may have had a negative impact on completer’s beliefs of their impact on student learning. 2022 Completer Survey 97.15% of employers who responded to the 2018-2019 survey stated completers were Very Well to Extremely Well prepared to impact P-12 Student Learning. 2021-2022 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENT: Prepared for traditional classrooms, need to prepare for differentiated environments based on student strengths, gaps in learning and student interest Troy University graduates are always prepared for providing students a quality education in the classroom. 2022 Employer Survey 2021-2022 EMPLOYER FOCUS GROUP COMMENT: Both interviewed administrators strongly stated that I would like to hire more TROY graduates because they come to us well-prepared in knowledge and the course of study standards, and they look forward to working with P-12 students. One large school system that hires many of our graduates from all programs shared completed teacher evaluations from the administrators at 8 schools ranging from early childhood to high school. This large school system hires many of our graduates from all programs. These evaluations conducted by administrators utilized a proprietary protocol. This observation tool evaluates teacher behaviors that influence P-12 learning and administrator comments included student behaviors. Observations are scored 0-Ineffective, 1-Developing, 2-Effective, 3-Exemplary. With less than 10 individuals listed most programs (indicated by an *), the EPP categorized the programs into Early Childhood and Elementary and Secondary (Middle school to high school).

The Classroom Management indicator mean score was just below 2.0- effectiveness at 1.81, corroborating data from completer and employer surveys. However, the score for the secondary completers was lower overall at 1.68. Although all programs are not represented separately in this data collection, scores indicate TROY completers have a positive influence on effective P-12 student learning. Comments from the administrators on strengths and weaknesses included: Early Childhood*, Elementary Collab K-6* Art*, Science*, Math*, History*, ELA* The summary of growth/focus will be used as suggestions to improve the programs at TROY. The Summary of Strengths will be included as strengths in the programs to maintain. Data suggests the EPP completers have a positive impact on P12 student learning. While data collected is still too small to make conclusive results, the EPP remains diligent to increase the number of student data and teacher evaluations by increasing the number of partner schools who will provide the data. Two new school systems will provide data for the 2022-2023 school year. With a new Director of the Certification and Field Experience Office, partnerships will be re-established and stronger with consistent leadership. Her staff have been developing databases, visiting school systems, and talking with P12 school administration. One action that was started prior to the pandemic was adding a volunteer opportunity to completers taking the Completer survey. They can volunteer to provide pre- and post-test data. Once individuals add their contact information, an email is sent to them with the data request, with a link to add the data to a Qualtrics form. With partner schools joining us in the data collection, having school administration send out the email will make it more likely for completers to open the email and then decide if they would like to help the EPP. With the school system sending it out, completers know the school system has approved the data sharing. 2021-2022 EMPLOYER SURVEY 2021-2022 EMPLOYER SURVEY COMMENT Prepared for traditional classrooms, need to prepare for differentiated environments based on student strengths, gaps in learning and student interest Troy Graduates tend to be more prepared to enter the classroom ready to go; they have more practical application of classroom management and investigative practices. 2022 Employer Survey 2022 Educator Preparation Institutional Report Card for Performance on Required Content Knowledge and Pedagogy Tests and Responses to the First-Year Teacher Survey created by the Alabama Association of Colleges for Teacher Education for Troy University.

Troy University’s online MS in Education is a 36-credit program designed for practicing teachers in public or private school settings. Courses are 100 percent online – though some courses are also available on campus for students who prefer a hybrid program. Troy’s program also allows for flexible course planning, so that students are not confined to regimented course sequences and can take full- or part-time course loads. All teacher education certification programs are approved by the Alabama State Department of Education. The U.S. Department of Education reports that high-quality teacher preparation can make a dramatic impact on student outcomes – even outweighing negative factors like poverty. 97.15% of employers would hire more Troy University Completers. Over 31% of Troy University graduates have been employed with their school system for three or more years. 83.89% of Troy University Completers demonstrate Professionalism Very Well to Extremely Well.

The following diversity categories with completer ratings are: SURVEY COMMENTS 2022 Employer Survey The purpose of all certification programs in the College of Education is to develop practicing master teachers, instructional support personnel, and education specialists who more effectively serve students in P-12 settings. As master teachers, instructional support personnel, and education specialists, they participate as leaders in their schools and contribute to their profession. Each candidate completes the state approved checklist for their particular program. Based on the recommendation to ALSDE, derived from the completion of the R & R/Review & Recommendation for Application Based on Completion of an Alabama Class A Program and Class AA Program and the Supplemental NA1/Recommendation for Certification forms, all completed. However, one candidate not listed, did not want certification in Alabama and did not complete the paperwork. Two reasons have been uncovered as to why completers may not meet licensure requirements. One reason is that they have not submitted their licensure paperwork in a timely manner. Therefore, the submission shows up for the next academic year or years later. Another reason completers may not meet licensure requirements is that they have not been able to pass the Praxis exam in their field required by the Alabama State Department of Education. These individuals would not submit paperwork until they meet requirements or remember to complete the paperwork. The EPP discovered that graduates are not required to have certification in order to get the pay raise for the higher degree. Some completers submit an Official Transcript to the HR department at their schools to receive the pay raise & forget to complete process for certification. To remind candidates of the process, advanced programs started adding an addendum to syllabi to remind students to submit certification paper. Programs with internships/practicums include details about the certification process in a handbook. 90.63% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed full-time teaching. 3.13% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were employed outside of the teaching field. 3.13% of the Troy University College of Education Department of Teacher' Education Completers that responded indicated that they were attending college to earn an advanced degree. Some teaching field positions have limited openings. Teachers will earn their certification in another field in order to be ready to apply and be hired when there is an opening. For example, the number of gifted specialists in a school system are low. General education teachers will earn gifted certification to be eligible to be hired when a position opens up or a new one is created.

The robotics competition is a high-energy sports-like environment but good sportsmanship is essential. Student-driven robots compete against the challenges of the game, not other robots. Each year's game theme and playing field is revealed in early August or mid-September. Teams are given eight weeks to design and build their robot before entering their local competition. In addition to robotics, the most coveted award of the program is the BEST Award. To compete, students must provide an engineering notebook, give an oral marketing presentation, construct an educational exhibit, and show excellent team spirit and sportsmanship. BEST uses the excitement of robotics to teach engineering and business processes. Formed in 2018, the Troy University BEST Robotics hub was formed under Best Robotics Inc. to serve students in southeast Alabama.

Letter to Parents,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Chancellor Jack Hawkins, Jr. Dear Trojan Parents: September 8, 2023 will go down in history as a major milestone for Troy University. On that day the Alabama Commission on Higher Education approved an instructional role change recognizing TROY as a doctoral-level institution. This is a significant milestone for TROY. Under our previous instructional role, we were limited to three doctoral programs. We launched our first in 2010, and have since proven that we can recruit, retain, and graduate students at the doctoral level. We felt the time was right for TROY to seek official recognition as a doctoral institution. TROY now has the ability to offer all doctoral programs needed to support research and generation of knowledge in the region. Plans are already underway to propose the addition of a Ph.D. in Criminology and a Doctor of Business Administration. What does this mean for you and your student? For one, it means you made the right college choice. Even if your student never earns a master's or doctorate, the value of all TROY degrees will increase significantly. The University's ambitions extend further to achieving Carnegie R2 status and formal recognition as a research institution. We are already making great strides towards this goal, as grant-funded research projects are on the rise and we near completion of our first building dedicated exclusively to research. Once we are recognized as a full-fledged research institution, our students and alumni will see their degrees further increase in value and stature. The best days for Troy University lie ahead, and the journey is just beginning. The TROY football team under head coach Jon Sumrall finished the 2023 season in spectacular fashion on Saturday, Dec. 2, defeating App State at home to win our second-consecutive Sun Belt Conference Championship. It was a thrilling end to the regular season—yet one that continues as we look forward to playing DUKE in the Birmingham Bowl on December 23, 2023! I am proud of the players and coaches who worked hard to make this possible. We believe the future is bright for the Trojans, which is why we were pleased to announce plans for a $10 million indoor practice facility, which will truly be a game-changer for football and all of TROY Athletics. Troy University continues to be ranked by the most prestigious services in the nation, which we embrace as validation of our programs.

When the Trojans take to the field this spring, we will have the best baseball facility in our league and one of the finest in the Southeast. A study-abroad experience should be part of your student's journey at TROY. I have seen countless students benefit from traveling overseas to learn about other cultures. One student told me after a trip to Pietrasanta, Italy, that: “It has given me the courage to explore the unknown.” I can think of no better endorsement! I have already seen announcements of spring 2024 study-abroad opportunities! In May, our students will travel to Italy to visit Venice, Florence, and Rome. In June, Spain will be the destination with stops in Madrid, Barcelona and Costa Brava. Have your student contact our Office of Study Abroad at 334-808-6128 to find out more information about the opportunities that await them! TROY provides $1,250 in study-abroad scholarships, available to all our students, both in class and online, who have successfully completed one full semester at TROY, have registered full-time, are in good academic standing, possess a minimum overall GPA of 2.5 and have completed the TROY Abroad application. Students may apply annually, which means students can receive $5,000 in assistance for international study during their academic career. The scholarship is funded through sales of TROY license plates for automobiles or boats to Alabama residents. The gift is tax-deductible, and $48 of the cost goes to scholarships.

International in scope, Troy University provides a variety of educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels for a diverse student body in traditional and nontraditional and emerging electronic formats. Academic programs are supported by a variety of student services, which promote the welfare of the individual student. Troy University’s dedicated faculty and staff promote discovery and exploration of knowledge dedicated to life-long success through effective teaching, creative partnerships, scholarship and research. (Approved by the Board of Trustees in April 2004, the mission will be reviewed every five years, or as needed). The Board of Trustees is the legal governing body of Troy University. As such, it is the final institutional authority. Its powers are set forth in Title 16, Chapter 56, Sections 1 & 3 of the Code of Alabama (1975) as amended in act #97-586 of the Alabama State Legislature. The Board of Trustees shall consist of representation from seven geographic areas of the state as denoted. One board member shall be appointed from each of the areas except for area two where two members will be appointed. Additionally, two trustees at-large who may or may not be residents of the state shall be appointed. The Governor of Alabama serves as ex-officio President of the Board. The President of the Student Government Association serves as a non-voting member. Alabama law explicitly prohibits a University employee from serving as a member of the Board of Trustees. Board members are appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Alabama Senate. Each member is appointed for a term of twelve years, but appointments are staggered so that one-third of the members may be chosen quadrennially. Membership and terms of office are published annually in the University Bulletin. The primary responsibility of the Board of Trustees is the articulation of general educational policies and academic goals. In so doing, it is obligated to conserve the financial resources of the University and to relate them to the likely needs of the future. While maintaining a general overview, the Board of Trustees entrusts the conduct of administration to the Chancellor and through the Chancellor to other administrative officers of the University; and to the faculty, the Board of Trustees entrusts the conduct of teaching and research. When ignorance or ill will threatens the institution or any part of it (e.g., an attack on freedom), the Board of Trustees is available for the support of the Chancellor, the faculty, or the student body, thereby defending the vested interests of society in Troy University.. The Board of Trustees who shall also establish the Chancellor’s salary, compensation and any other condition of employment, shall appoint the chancellor of the university. It is the responsibility of the Board of Trustees to select the chief executive officer—the Chancellor—and to set forth those duties and responsibilities. As the chief executive officer of the institution, the Chancellor supervises and directs the affairs of the University. It is the duty of the Chancellor to assure that the standards and procedures in operational use within the institution conform to the policies established by the Board of Trustees and to the standards of sound academic practice. The Chancellor shares responsibility for the definition and attainment of goals and for operating the communications system that links the various components of the University: Board of Trustees; other officers of administration; faculty; staff; and students. The Chancellor is the chief spokesman and representative of the Troy University and works for public support and understanding. The Chancellor is largely responsible for the maintenance of existing institutional resources and the creation of new resources. In all these areas, the responsibilities of the Chancellor are to plan, organize, direct, and represent. The Chancellor coordinates the administration of all institutional operations. The University shall have a strategic planning process that maintains a current strategic plan in which institutional priorities are defined and through which the institution's mission is carried out in accordance with the strategic directions and guiding principles established by the Board. The faculty and staff shall be involved in developing the plan and shall be included in the structure by which the plan is implemented. In addition, there shall be a formal process by which systematic assessment of the progress and effectiveness of the plan is conducted. Assessment processes shall also assess general education, degree programs, academic and student support programs, administrative programs, research initiatives, and community service activities. The faculty and staff shall be involved in developing assessment processes and included in the structure by which those processes are implemented and used for improvement. Approved: Chancellor's Cabinet, Nov 30,2011OPR: IRPEReview: Every Five Years The institution shall conduct an academic program review every two years, consistent with efforts in institutional effectiveness and strategic planning.

Design Center,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Center for Design, Technology, and Industry, or DTI.center, was established in 2000 as a student-driven graphic design studio that develops graphics and other forms of visual communication for businesses and institutions. Through mentorship, real-world experience, competition and entrepreneurship, DTI.center is preparing its students for success. DTI.center was founded on the idea that graphic design can serve as a catalyst for social change and economic growth. As such, it is integral to our global community; being a designer comes with a great responsibility both to its clients and audiences. DTI.center strives to create graphics that are beautiful, effective, innovative, and meaningful. Here, students learn to see graphic design as more than a job, but a way of thinking and seeing the world; graphic design is not only something beautiful to look at, but a powerful means of conveying a message. Students are encouraged to stay aware of what’s happening in visual communication, to know the current, and evolving design meta, to be risk takers, and creative innovators. Technology is essential in the field of graphic design and its rapid progression is constantly changing the role and responsibility of graphic designers. In this field, it’s important to be aware of current and evolving technologies and analytics. This, combined with the dynamic trends and upheavals of design itself, pushes students even further to become adaptable and open to the unknown. DTI.center considers itself techno-centric, encouraging all of its students to exploit the creative tools as are available to them. Every design student is expected to own, maintain and subscribe to the latest technology and to master it. We also recognize the impact and value of social media marketing. Students learn how to establish a notable presence and to successfully influence an audience directly through technology. A driving principle of DTI.center is the integration of business and design. In addition to providing full network communication services, DTI.center has established a collaborative partnership with the Marketing Department in the Sorrell College of Business. Design and Marketing students receive the valuable experience of going beyond the academic classroom by working alongside professional clientele and discovering effective, innovative visual solutions to each new client's specialized needs. Each student team competes in order to have their work chosen and published, and are capable of earning a commission. Through our agency, clientele ranging from nonprofit organizations to established businesses gain access to a wide range of promising talent and fresh ideas.

About Us,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The department consists of a group of highly trained and experienced faculty members who dedicate themselves to teaching and helping students prepare for geospatial careers with the latest technologies in both hardware and software. The department offers small-size classes and emphasizes personal attention to each student. The goal of each professor and instructor is to see their students succeed in their respective geospatial careers. The department’s goal is to prepare students to get ready to pursue ever-growing opportunities in the geospatial professions. “In surveying and geomatics, we use drones a lot — to collect data and to generate maps in a fast and efficient way,” said Department Chair Xutong Niu. “This department can help us unite all the expertise. We can better utilize our personnel and expand our efforts into a broader area now.” “The initial intent for people who joined the geomatics program was to become licensed surveyors, but the GIS focus is also giving them the additional incentive to be employable in different areas,” said Geomatics Program Director Dr. Steve Ramroop. Dr. Niu said ""I have communicated with engineering companies, law enforcement agencies and energy companies who are interested in hiring students trained in geospatial informatics. "" Dr. Ramroop added, “Another thing with geospatial informatics is it is technology driven. We are using the best of the best hardware and software, which is one reason why all of our students are employable. You name the field, and there are jobs out there for our students.” “It’s a growing need that more and more are recognizing,” Dr. Niu said referring to the GIS major. “Recently I talked to a representative from the Alabama Department of Public Health, and he told me they need more GIS data. People use GIS every day, whether they realize it or not. It’s a need that is expanding worldwide, from cell phones to map services to governmental agencies."" “We want companies to know that our students are here, they are ready and they are employable,” Dr. Ramroop said. “And also, we want our students to know that companies are ready to hire them.”",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-arts-sciences/departments/school-science-technology/geospatial-informatics/about/index.html

International in scope, Troy University provides a variety of educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels for a diverse student body in traditional and nontraditional and emerging electronic formats. Academic programs are supported by a variety of student services, which promote the welfare of the individual student. Troy University’s dedicated faculty and staff promote discovery and exploration of knowledge dedicated to life-long success through effective teaching, creative partnerships, scholarship and research. Research and creative work are requisites for effective teaching and active involvement in the intellectual and scholarly developments of an individual's field. What is considered appropriate research in one discipline may not be recognized as appropriate in another discipline; therefore, research or creative work should be evaluated in terms of its quality, its level of recognition among peers, and its significance to the advancement of the academic discipline. Moreover, the University recognizes that not all research ends in publication and that the significance of all research and creative endeavors is that it underscores and illumines excellent classroom teaching. Evidence of appropriate endeavors and activities includes: Sponsored research is defined as that research funded through external means to include federal, state, corporate and private sources. All research at Troy University must adhere to guidelines for a particular project as set forth by the funding agency and in accordance with the procedures of the institution. The OSP encourages, facilitates, and supports the development of proposals. Because project opportunities should be related to the predetermined interests of the University, the Office of Sponsored Programs will verify that all projects are related to the purpose and goals of Troy University. The OSP is also responsible for assuring that all agency guidelines and University policies are followed. The OSP staff identifies sources of external funding and assists faculty and administrators in all aspects of securing grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other types of awards. The OSP maintains funding source databases and references, and provides, or will obtain, sponsor guidelines and application forms. The OSP provides advice on funding possibilities, conceptualization of projects, budget preparation, filling of applications, proposal editing and review, as well as other aspects of the proposal development. In addition, the OSP, in consultation with the principal investigator, may assist in negotiating the terms of the award. The OSP serves as a communications link between and among the University community and outside sponsors --- federal, state, and private sector foundations and corporations. The goal of the OSP is to help faculty and administrators secure funding and limit the burden of administrative and accountability responsibilities associated with that funding. The OSP will develop and maintain a Procedures and Required Guidelines Manual that sets forth the requirements for all personnel engaged in sponsored program activities. Prior to the development of a proposal the PI must obtain approval from the OSP. Before a proposal can be processed by OSP and submitted to a funding agency, the principal investigator (PI) must obtain the required endorsement of the appropriate administrators as designated in the OSP Procedures and Required Guidelines Manual. A grant is defined as fund secured through a competitive process Contracts Contracts are defined as an agreement to perform services or deliver a product or goods within a specified period of time and for an agreed-to-price. Payment conditions vary from advance payments and monthly reimbursements to recovery of costs only after completion of the contract and acceptance of performance by the sponsoring agency. Sponsors sometimes require that a portion of the total project costs be contributed from other sources. Contributions may be in the form of cost sharing and matching. Cost sharing and matching funds are usually a university contribution, however; they may come from external support. Any cost sharing arrangement requires adherence to the guidelines established in the OSP Procedures and Required Guidelines Manual, as well as the approval of appropriate administrators as identified in the above manual. Human Subjects: The use of human subjects in a research proposal must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). This is accomplished by submission of a human subject’s protocol to the IRB. Information regarding Human Subjects. Animal Welfare: Proposals that involve the use of live vertebrate animals, regardless of the funding source, must be reviewed and approved by the Animal Research Review Board. Prior to proposal submission, an initial contact must be made with the Director of the OSP. For information about the procedures for conducting animal research, contact the Chair of the Animal Research Review Board. Bio-Safety: Proposals and laboratory teaching activities which employ the use of recombinant DNA (which are not exempt from NIH guidelines), infectious agents, teratogens, mutagens, carcinogens, biohazards, hazardous waste, and the Environmental Committee must review radioactive material. For information, contact the OSP. Other Other compliance issues may be developed and primary investigators must check with the OSP to ensure that they are in compliance with new standards. A university faculty is made up of highly trained professionals, many of them of national and international reputation, representing a substantial reservoir of human resources. Services of this group are available to the various sectors of society for the mutual benefit of industry, government, the academic community and society at large. Outside employment and activities are encouraged, provided they do not detract from the full and competent performance of a faculty member's duties. In light of this, faculty whose activities are paid from grants or contracts should be aware of potential conflict of interest situations. The policy is explained in detail in the Troy University Faculty Handbook, and the Troy University Staff Handbook. The following represent prohibited activities or activities that can be permitted only with conditions: Reporting Responsibilities Reporting responsibilities for sponsored projects fall into two categories: Financial reporting and technical reporting. Financial reports are sent to the sponsoring agency and prepared by the Project Manager, OSP and Accounting Services. The Principle Investigator (PI) or Project Director prepares the technical reports with assistance from the OSP liaison. When a PI receives an award, he/she should determine what the agency requires in terms of reporting. It is imperative that reports are submitted in a timely manner and in accordance with the agency’s requirements. Accounting Services assists in the preparation of all necessary financial reports. Most agencies require that final financial reports be submitted within 60-90 days after the termination of a project. In order for Accounting Services to meet these deadlines, it is imperative that any problems in an account, such as outstanding encumbrances, be cleared within 30-60 days of the termination of the project. Patents and Copyrights Patentable discoveries or inventions may result during the course of research on a sponsored project. Policies related to patents and copyrights are set forth in the Troy University Faculty Handbook. Inventory/Property Control Any item of permanent equipment costing $5000 or more is marked with a permanent Troy University identification number and becomes a part of the annual inventory of permanent equipment. Title to permanent equipment purchased with funds from a grant or contract varies by funding agency. To determine the title to any permanent equipment purchased on a specific grant or contract, one should consult the terms and conditions applicable to the grant or contract. Specific questions related to inventory/property control should be directed to the Director of Purchasing. External Audits Sponsored project accounts are periodically audited by external agencies. OSP Accounting Services and the OSP liaison coordinate all contact with external auditors concerning sponsored projects. In cases in which an audit team requires files, documentation, or discussion with other campus personnel, OSP Accounting Services will make arrangements for these discussions or information, and usually a University accountant will review any materials and will be present at any discussions. If an external auditor contacts a project director, he/she should refer the auditor to the Principal Investigator’s assigned grant or contract accountant. Close-out of fixed price agreements Fixed Price Agreements that have been satisfactorily completed (all the terms of the agreement have been met) and have cash (budget) available must be closed by sending a memo, and executing other such steps as may be required, to Sponsored Programs Accounting. Consultant Payments and Independent Service Consultant payments on sponsored projects must represent compensation to individuals who are independent of the university and who render independent services. The University may not make consultant payments to faculty, staff or other employees where an employer/employee relationship exists. Rather, in these situations employees should be compensated for services via the University personnel/payroll system according to percent effort of committed time; or donate their services as professional courtesy. On the whole, it is expected that consulting needs can be satisfied from resources within the University community. When outside consulting services are needed for a grant or contract, all of these conditions must be met:",https://www.troy.edu/epolicy/500-grants-research.html

Past Exhibitions,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Rosa Parks Museum at Troy University will be hosting Homeless, an art exhibition by sculptor Jim Hager. Hager lived in Oakland, California, where the number of unhoused individuals continues to grow…a problem that we also face right here in our own community of Montgomery, Alabama. Hager decided to use his art as a tool to create awareness and action on critical issues facing our communities. The Rosa Parks Museum is hoping to use this exhibition to do the same here. [Exhibit on display from 8/8/2024 through 10/26/2024.] Life Behind the Fence: Echoes of Incarceration is an evocative exhibition that delves into the unseen world of incarcerated individuals and the indelible marks left on their families. Each brushstroke captures the silent stories of resilience and despair, hope and longing, that resonate within the confines of prison walls. This collection of paintings serves as a poignant narrative, chronicling the journey of those who find themselves in the grip of the justice system. The images are powerful vignettes of life in incarceration—depicting the mundane alongside the profound, the moments of quiet reflection, and the bursts of raw emotion. As viewers traverse the gallery, they are invited to witness the complex tapestry of relationships strained by bars and barriers. The artworks reveal the faces of youth whose potential is overshadowed by their circumstances, and adults whose dreams are deferred by their sentences. It is a world where time stands still, yet life moves forward in the hearts of those who wait for their return. The impact on families is a recurring theme, portrayed with both subtlety and intensity. The paintings illustrate the strength of familial bonds, the pain of separation, and the shared burden of stigma. They challenge us to consider the collateral damage of incarceration—the children left behind, the partners rendered single, and the parents grappling with absence. Life Behind the Fence is not just an exhibition; it is a conversation starter, a catalyst for change, and a mirror reflecting the often-overlooked aspects of our society. It beckons us to look closer, to understand deeper, and to extend compassion wider. This is an invitation to engage with the art, to let it move you, and to carry its message beyond the gallery walls. It is a call to acknowledge the humanity that persists, behind the fence. [Exhibit on display from 5/20/2024 through 7/17/2024.] Erace is an impactful exhibition that centers on the theme of historical erasure, particularly its effects on Black communities in America. Through a compelling artistic lens, artist Takeisha Jefferson examines the ongoing struggle faced by Black Americans, from the legacy of slavery to contemporary challenges. Erace invites viewers to confront the consequences of silenced narratives, encouraging deep reflection on the broader theme of historical memory and its implications for justice and equality. This exhibition serves as a vital platform for dialogue, fostering a greater awareness of the importance of acknowledging and preserving those marginalized histories. [Exhibit on display from 1/25/2024 through 4/20/2024.] Artist Alana Enfinity currently resides in Montgomery Alabama but was born in San Francisco, California, and raised in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. Her travels have helped influence her perspectives on life and art. At a young age, she acquired the important introduction into art and its possibilities. Having an unstable home life, she was able to find comfort and constancy in art. Alana navigated through several mediums throughout her artist development. Her understanding of these diverse mediums and processes is used to create works that symbolize the healing processes we all encounter in life. In her artistry, you will see recurring visual stories of healing, symbolism, and technology though expansion. Explorations in the Youniverse, Vol. 2 examines how each of us, as humans, finds our place in the universe. In a world that often emphasizes external beauty and superficial emotions, it is essential that we remember that true beauty lies in authenticity and vulnerability. Our internal universe is just as important as the external world we inhabit, and we must learn to navigate it just as skillfully. [Exhibit on display from 8/17/2023 through 11/11/2023] Stephen Mangum's new body of paintings confront his Southern heritage and explore racial injustice through the lens of white privilege. As a white child growing up in Greenwood, Mississippi, in the 1950s and ‘60s, his memories are of playing baseball and kick-the-can, riding his bike, and taking art lessons...not of the plight of Black citizens during that same time period. He was a toddler when Emmett Till was abducted and murdered in nearby Money, Mississippi, and was a third grader when Medgar Evers was assassinated in Jackson. As a teenager, however, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was gunned down in Memphis, Tennessee, Mangum became fully aware of the depth of the hatred and bigotry that surrounded him. Recreating scenes from the struggle for Civil Rights by such 1960's photojournalists as Charles Moore, Matt Herron, and Bill Hudson, and then superimposing current day portraits of his grandchildren, Mangum's paintings link the past with the present. By illustrating that the racism and inhumanity of his childhood continue to permeate the American landscape, he hopes to encourage dialogue towards unity. [Exhibit on display May 4 - July 22, 2023] *Exhibit made possible in part through a generous grant from the Alabama State Council on the Arts. A Song of The South is a compilation of works by Alabama native son, John “Jahni” Moore. Jahni is a Southern-born artist who weaves the dichotomy of Southern tapestry into a vision of perspective and possibility. ""This exhibition speaks from a single lens with a panoramic view of past, present, and future. Each work pulls from the bedrock of the Southern experience. Not just from walking through the red clay of Alabama but by acknowledging the red clay as space / magic dust divinely cultivated into miracle territory. From the charcoal drawings and red clay paintings to the red clay-infused acrylic paintings, the work is charged with ancestral power and sanctity. From Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville to Red Mountain in Birmingham to the red riverbanks and shores of Montgomery down to Mobile, the magical red dust is the stuff of Alabama. This work is about resurrection, remembrance, and redemption. From this hallowed ground, we feel both the harmony and discord of our ancestors, the voices of those who came before and will come after, drifting in to us in visual verse - a song unique to this Southern plane."" ~ Jahni the Artist [Exhibit on display January 13 - April 8, 2023] *Exhibit made possible through a generous grant from the Alabama State Council on the Arts. “Artists are the gatekeepers of truth. We are civilization's radical voice.” – Paul Robeson The River Region has a rich history of not only activism but of visual and performance art.

[Exhibit on display October 21 - December 10, 2022] The Rosa Parks Museum's current exhibit Look Where He Has Brought Us From displays the history of the African Methodist Episcopal church in Alabama. In collaboration with the Selma-Montgomery district of the 9th District of Alabama, the exhibit displays documents, articles, and artifacts from the 150+ years of the AME church in the state. This exhibit was one of the last requests of former Troy University Board of Trustee member Lamar P. Higgins and is being hosted in his honor. Mr Higgins was instrumental in the history of the regional AME church and that of his home church (and Rosa Parks' home church) St. Paul AME, as well as the development and continued success of the Rosa Parks Museum. [Exhibit on display through October 1, 2022] /ˈwäCHˌfī(ə)r/“A fire maintained during the night as a signal or for the use of someone who is on watch.”– Lexico In the artist's opinion, separations within the United States have reached dangerous levels, and the deadly global pandemic has made them worse. Foreign countries actively encourage election interference. White Supremacists march openly in the streets. Gerrymandering and targeted removal of voting locations happens as we stand here now. Intoxicating greed and an insatiable lust for power infiltrates and taintsour current politics and religion. Manners and respect towards one another have been thrown out like yesterday's garbage. We have never truly been the “home of the free” and we continue fighting the same civil rights battles more than 66 years after Rosa Parks' arrest. Noble veterans, both Black and white, who have paid the ultimate price to fight against the spread of evil, authoritarianism, and fascism, would be shocked at how the values they fought to protect are being purposefully eliminated. Those heroes and sentinels are gone. Now is the time for us to pick up the light that has fallen and take their place – we must be the Watchfires. Now more than ever, we need the Watchfires to burn again through thenight… To light up the darkness as a beacon of hope, strength, freedom, equality, and civility, To illuminate the path that once was traveled, So people can find their way home. [January 13 - June 19, 2022] ""Ten Japanese-American Concentration Camps"" by returning artist Renee Billingslea is a photo documentation project that shows the drastic impact Executive Order 9066 had on society; many of these effects can still be seen today. This order called for the mass deportation and incarceration of more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in 1942. Billingslea's exhibit is a stark reminder that our history has shaped who we are as individuals and as a country in 2021. Her meshing of old photographs with present day images allows viewers to examine our past in ways that historical photos cannot. [October 14 - December 31, 2021] Willie Little's visual narratives document a fading part of rural southern life while also tackling topics of racism and Black Lives Matter, social justice, and the childhood memories of growing up on a tobacco farm in Eastern North Carolina. His work celebrates his rural upbringing while documenting a fading part of the American landscape. Assemblage and installation pieces are layered with humor, irony, complexity, and contradiction. Found objects come alive in the work as they speak with an unabashed honesty. Compositions engulf environments with a surreal sense of reality as they critique portions of America's social dilemmas. They invite us to open our minds and hearts to seek unexpected truths. Little is an artist whose genius incorporates sculpture, painting, sound installations, re-constructed architecture, re-cycled memorabilia, and real-life stories. Willie pours out his soul for all to see as he relives growing up during a time of radical change. The common thread in all the work he creates is his examination of the manifestations of physical and societal decay in American culture. In the series Nodder Doll/ Living Doll, the “nodder” (bobble head) picaninny banks, made of ceramic and chalk, were popular in Japan in the 1950s. They were marketed and sold to white Americans as a souvenir to “represent” Black Americana. Little defiantly repossesses and repurposes them, to elevate and celebrate their beauty from the ill-conceived form of degradation in their original intent. The assemblages sit proudly beside large-scale figurative portrait-like paintings on canvas and wood panels. The works hint and suggest the pieces could be living, breathing modern day adult manifestations of today's Black woman. The works become a trumpet or a mouth piece speaking to the subversive nature of racism in the past and present. Little reclaims the disrespectful and insulting imagery and uses found objects to embrace contemporary real-life issues and attempts to evoke the challenges, strength, and resilience of modern Black women. [July 1 - September 30, 2021] The Christian Debutante-Master Dedication Commission (CDMC) of the African Methodist Episcopal Church introduces young people to Christian society and celebrates their transition to adulthood through spiritual growth and development. They work collaboratively and diligently in fulfilling the A.M.E. commitment to “creating a future worthy of our past.” This year, the CDMC students were tasked with researching and creating works of art that focus on love overcoming hate. The works in this exhibit show that we as a community and a nation have much work to do in overcoming the hate that is still present in society. As Dr. King said, “Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.” [May 3 - 21, 2021] Veils can be an obvious covering; however, in this series, Takeisha Jefferson uses the veil in a multifaceted way. The artist wants the viewer to decide where the veil is for them. Is it literal or is it figurative? Some of the veils in her work are overt, while others can only be interpreted by the subject or audience. Finding artistry in her ancestry, the artworks give life to forgotten and unknown members of the artist's family, which sometimes challenges narratives. With her Veiled series, Jefferson has captured reflections of her ancestors from mainly photographing her four children. Many memories for us can be found through images of family members we have never met. Jefferson's intent is to provide a glimpse into her family's lost history with her photographic storytelling. [January 18 - April 2, 2021] Known as the “Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,” Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was the catalyst behind a movement that would forever change the world. On the evening of December 1, 1955, Mrs. Parks left her job at Montgomery Fair department store tired – not physically, but spiritually and emotionally. She had been involved in the fight for equality and social change for over 20 years prior to her arrest. She was involved in trying to free the Scottsboro Boys, was secretary and a sexual assault investigator for the local NAACP chapter, and an activist for education, voting rights, and youth leadership. Mrs. Parks and her family were driven out of town after the boycott, but that did not deter her activism. After moving to Detroit, Michigan, in 1957, she continued campaigning for voting rights, workers' rights, and women's rights as well as fighting against apartheid in South Africa, poverty, and unfair and unequal housing practices. Racial discrimination did not end when Rosa Parks refused to move from her seat. However, her courage helped spark a movement that had been simmering for decades. For 382 days, foot soldiers walked and carpooled through the Alabama heat, rain, and cold. The model used by the boycott leaders has influenced the organization of protests and marches to this day. Although these actions were extraordinary, they happened because of the passion and togetherness of ordinary individuals. Dr. King was a 26-year-old newcomer to Montgomery. Rosa Parks was a well-known seamstress. Claudette Colvin was a high school student. Jo Ann Robinson was a professor. Georgia Gilmore was a baker and chef. Sixty-five years after the Boycott, we know that one person can change everything. [November 30, 2020 - January 9, 2021] This exhibition draws its conceptual inspiration from the ecstatic tradition of ‘call and response', an essential element of the African American worship experience. Developed as a mechanism for democratic participation, the practice--which involves the vocal response to something being said in public gatherings, civic affairs, religious services and musical performances--traces its roots to cultural groups of Sub-Saharan Africa. Examples of the form can be found broadly in the worship style common to the Black Church in which ministers often say: “can I get a witness”, as the parishioners answer with “yes sir”, or “amen”. The practice was also a widespread feature of the ‘field holler songs' during the time of slavery. An overseer or driver would sing a metered chant that the field workers would respond to vocally, creating a rhythmic pace for the days work. In the context of this exhibition, the title refers to an internal calling of the soul that I attempt to answer through the language of visual art. The phrase also has an elasticity that can accommodate multiple meanings. This is a characteristic feature of the black vernacular tradition which often operates multivalently with the same word denoting different meanings depending on the context and the intonation of the speaker. In a similar fashion, the ‘Down yonder' in the title refers both to the deep south--the ancestral home of most African Americans--and the vast dimensions of the transcendent soul. Drawing on past and present moments in American history as points of inspiration--particularly those that coalesce around the enduring conundrum of race--this exhibition is one artist's response to the spiritual and material blight of bigotry and injustice. “Racism retards the unfoldment of the boundless potentialities of its victims, corrupts its perpetrators, and​ blights human progress. Recognition of the oneness of mankind, implemented by appropriate legal measures, must be universally upheld if this problem is to be overcome.” ~ The Baha'i writings [June 25 - October 17, 2020] Troy University's Rosa Parks Museum is pleased to announce its second annual Junior Curator exhibition in collaboration with That's My Child. This exhibition features Civil Rights era photographs and documents hand selected by students at That's My Child, who wrote labels for each piece. These works are in celebration of Black History Month and depict how the fight for civil rights has evolved over time. Special thanks to our partners: Alabama Department of Archives and History, Alabama Power Foundation, and Gisele C. Shorter, Ed.D. [January 16 - April 30, 2020] Alabama Art: Inside Out originated as an artistic endeavor by the artist Nall to reveal to the world the work of fellow Alabamian artists who embodied the spirit of his home state. He saw these artists as courageous and ambitious. They were able to flourish despite the challenges presented by a predominately conservative environment. As an avid art collector, Nall was constantly obtaining art that fed his soul. He has a keen interest in local artists, seeing that they share much in common. The Rosa Parks Museum and the International Arts Center is proud to bring to light the work embodying a colorful, southern culture reflecting Nall's vision. Gun culture has become highly romanticized in American culture. Today, guns are marketed as objects of amusement and have a place in American idioms and sports jargon. In convenience stores, cap guns and water guns are readily accessible for visitors and children. African Americans have a long history of being profiled and marked as a target. Targets can be anything, which is why Jones feels the need to define them and get the audience involved by letting visitors create their own conclusion of what they see in each target. Michael Jones was born in Dallas, Texas, where he attended the famed Booker T. Washington High School for Performing and Visual Arts. He relocated to Atlanta, Georgia in 1994 where he received his Bachelor's degree in Painting and Sculpture from Atlanta College of Art (SCAD) in 1998. His focus was in non-objective, abstract paintings. Newer works deal with definitions in which he uses mixed medium, collage, and found objects. In addition, he operates within interior and exterior urban spaces and honors the mundane materials that filter through our day-to-day lives. Please be advised this exhibition contains graphic content and may not be suitable for all ages. The courageous act of Rosa Louise McCauley Parks, who refused to give up her seat on a segregated Montgomery city bus on December 1, 1955, sparked the 382-day Montgomery Bus Boycott. Poll taxes, discrimination, and deadly racial violence that disenfranchised African Americans was countered with a 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery by about 3,200 protesters who demanded fairness in voter registration. Unfair wages and unsafe work conditions led Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to seek economic justice for striking sanitation workers in Memphis. Each of these historic events have inspired peaceful protests all over the world--from Tiananmen Square to Tahrir Square, from Kent State to Jackson State, and from Muhammad Ali to Colin Kaepernick. Tell us how you are inspired to make positive social change for justice and equality: #RosaParksMuseum, @RosaParksMuseum. The Rosa Parks Museum is excited to announce the opening of our summer exhibition, ""Break Glass: A Conversation to End Hate"" by artist V.L. Cox. The End Hate Project is a narrative body of work that looks at our history of discrimination, gender issues, and social culture. The powerful pieces convey messages that are aggressive, violent, disturbing, irreverent, and even humorous--but all show us as a society where we've been before and where we cannot allow ourselves to go again. Cox's recent work has been highly active in projects that involve human rights and equality. In 2015, she launched her National ""End Hate"" Installation Series, an anti-discrimination series that was placed twice on the steps of the Arkansas State Capitol and at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. This series employs authentic and found objects that create a visceral presentation commenting on raw emotions and relevant human rights issues that continue to be important topics in the 21st century. The work sets in motion strong emotions. Her creations are powerful, imaginative, and unprecedented in style. Cox has a keen and sensitive eye for three-dimensional detail and its impact on all aspects of design and composition in a work of art. In the eyes of the observers, Cox's paintings combine composition and depth, which are powerful and compel the viewer to interact with the artwork. For more information about the artist, visit www.vlcox.com. The experiences of African women past and present are diverse, sophisticated, and challenging. This exhibition celebrates the variety and complexity of these experiences through representations of African women and their artistic practices. Focused primarily on historical African art forms, the works here display the impact women have made historically in African culture. From images of women's power, spirit, and beauty to those of family and everyday life, the arts of Africa demonstrate the central place of female representations, gender concepts, and women artists in African culture. Visit the Savannah African Art Museum to experience over 1,000 objects in the Donald and Kay Cole Collection: https://www.facebook.com/SavannahAfricanArtMuseum/. During World War II, African American airmen served with distinction in segregated units within the Army Air Forces. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981, ending segregation in the US Armed Forces. By 1950, the Air Force led the way by integrating its units and bases, including Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. Working on bases allowed black service members and civilians to escape Jim Crow laws. Rosa Parks worked as a seamstress at Maxwell and her husband, Raymond, was a barber. “You might just say Maxwell opened my eyes up,” said Mrs. Parks. “It was an alternative reality to the ugly policies of Jim Crow.” Unfortunately, discrimination delayed progress within ranks and among civilian employees. “I did not experience any unpleasant incidents, but sometimes on base there were problems with individuals,” said Rosa Parks. The days of Jim Crow have passed. Since World War II, service men and women from all backgrounds have made remarkable achievements. Yet, the pursuit toward equality continues. ""The Fabric of Race,"" an exhibit by artist Renee Billingslea that examines racial violence and lynching in America, will open at Troy University's Rosa Parks Museum on April 20 with an opening reception set for 6 p.m. Read More The Rosa Parks Museum is thrilled to announce our newest exhibition, Cash Crop by artist Stephen Hayes.

Department of Teacher Education,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: Department of Teacher Education Faculty and Staff Welcome to the Teacher of Education Program Website! Thank you for visiting our page and we look forward to answering any questions you may have about our program. I am excited as our program continues to grow and develop to meet the ever changing needs of schools in Central and South Alabama. We strive to give students a global education while providing small enough class sizes to support individual needs. Troy University has a long history in teacher preparation. The first teaching certificates were issued in 1888 when Troy University established itself as a leader in the field with highly sought-after graduates. The Department of Teacher Education is proud to uphold that heritage. You are invited to share in our love of teaching and learning by exploring the many possibilities available to you in educational career paths. If you want to be well-prepared for the challenges of teaching, as our students consistently demonstrate, this is the place for you! The Department of Teacher Education offers initial teacher preparation programs and advanced educational degree programs that prepare graduates to be teachers who make a difference in the lives of those they touch. The department works with several other academic units to prepare students to become early childhood, elementary, collaborative, secondary and interdisciplinary teachers in the following degree programs: View Academic Programs All programs are accredited by the Alabama State Department of Education, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (now Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation). Courses are delivered using traditional methods and modern technologies, including online, and web-enhanced instruction. Campus courses are taught in technology-equipped classrooms. Programs are offered on four Alabama campuses and online to provide for the needs of today's students. Dr. Joseph JohnsonDepartment of Teacher Education Chair Teaching has been the backbone of Troy University since 1887.

J-Day Information,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: We are currently planning for J-Day 2024 on October 2! The Troy University Hall School of Journalism and Communication is proud to present J-day each fall in order to educate future college students about the options they have when choosing a career path in the field of journalism. This year's event will be held on Wednesday, October 2, 2024 on Troy's campus. J-Day’s purpose is to provide information in a relaxed, fun atmosphere, including educational workshops, lectures, lunch and student media competition. Students will find a creative, enjoyable atmosphere that allows learning to happen naturally. There are many benefits to participating in J-Day. Students will find opportunities to ask questions of our instructors, speakers and volunteers that will offer insight into what they should expect out of their Trojan experience. Our volunteers are made up of students, and the first-hand knowledge they have could prove very valuable to those considering a degree from the Hall School. Our instructors are dedicated to teaching students how to find information and think for themselves. Independent thought is held in high regard on all TROY campuses; however, with the push toward the Multimedia Journalism platform, where each reporter is a self-contained news-gathering, editing, and delivery service, the importance of independence, an essential asset to the aspiring reporter, cannot be overstated. Newsrooms, live crews, and tech studios have downsized since the advent, acceptance, and adoption of the online news platform. Using computers and the Internet, it is now possible for one person to do the jobs of many, and the push towards this as the standard of journalism is pretty clear. By taking advantage of J-Day, motivated students gain the advantage of seeing not only how things work here, but also whether or not the fields of journalism or communication are the proper fit for them. So, as you can see, the benefits of participation in J-Day revolve heavily around the idea of increasing the knowledge of those who attend. After all, isn’t that what journalism is all about? J-Day consists of a number of informative and engaging workshops presented by both faculty and guest speakers. These workshops are designed to raise interest among potential students about the different aspects of gathering, processing and presenting information to the public. Workshop session examples include: Advisers Only: SCHEDULE 7:30-8:00 Check-in (Breakfast ends at 8:15 a.m.)8:00-9 Welcome/Awards 1:00 End of J-Day *A Detailed schedule will be emailed to all registrants.

Programs for Teachers,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: In partnership with the Southeast Alabama Regional Inservice Center (SEARIC)Troy University, Wiregrass Writing Project Teacher Consultants (TCs) provide hundreds of quality professional development workshops in a variety of formats. All workshops are designed to assist teachers in incorporating best practices to provide instruction that accelerates student achievement. The Wiregrass Writing Project Teacher Consultants are prepared to work with our area school districts to design unique programs to meet specific needs. Leadership teams from the Writing Project meet with administrators and leadership teams of teachers to determine content needs, delivery strategies, and scheduling. Tailored staff development provides districts with the necessary tools to meet the increasing demands of Writing Assessments, Subject Area Testing Programs, and Alabama Course of Study based assessments. National Writing Project and Alabama Writing Project resources are made available to schools through tailored programs. Teacher consultants present process-based lessons in teachers' classrooms, aligned with state and district standards. Small groups of teachers are debriefed on the strategies used in the demonstrations. Classroom demonstrations have been so successful that schools are now requesting scheduled classroom demonstrations as an integral part of their professional development programs. Wiregrass Writing Project (WWP) staff assist school faculty in choosing relevant reading material for a year-long book study. During regularly scheduled ""book club"" style meetings, WWP staff facilitate discussions of the reading and, when appropriate, model strategies for classroom implementation. Book study sessions are often held during teachers' planning times so that this program does not interfere with daily instructional time. Wiregrass Writing Project (WWP) staff select relevant reading material for a five-week book study that targets specific writing strategies. During scheduled on-line meetings, WWP staff facilitate discussions of the reading and when appropriate, model strategies for classroom implementation. Book study participants develop and share lesson implementing strategies spotlighted during the book study. Wiregrass Writing Project Attention: Dr. Robin Bynum 025 Hawkins Hall Troy University Troy, AL 36082 inservice @troy.edu 334-670-5978 or 334-670-3495 The WWP provides professional development, develops resources, generates research, and acts on knowledge to improve the teaching of writing and learning in schools and communities. We believe that teachers are key to helping other teachers; therefore, we believe strongly in the concept of teachers teaching teachers. During our Invitational Summer Institute (ISI) we follow a shared National Writing Project model that includes identifying and developing teacher leaders and educator leaders, providing support for educators in our local service area, and providing a professional home for educators' continued learning. The leadership cadre of local teachers' participants called “teacher consultants” focus on the following activities during the Invitational Summer Institute: Who should attend: 2025 Institute is scheduled for: June 6, 13, and 27, 2025, will be face-to-face and will be held on the Troy University Troy Campus, Troy, AL, from 8:30 AM to 3:30 PM. All educators across the disciplines, K-16, are eligible to attend and may earn college credit (EDU 6672) or receive professional development (140) contact hours.

Etiquette,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: We have such wonderful students at TROY! In the early 1990's, the Honors Leadership class requested an etiquette lesson so it would be better prepared for business luncheons. I have since given a version of this lesson to other campus groups and classes. The following are a few of the students' frequently asked questions, as well as some dining do's and don'ts we've discussed. We also talk about such topics as thank-you notes, R.S.V.P.'s, handshakes and proper dress. We have fun at these sessions and learn a lot. The food served at the luncheons has been delicious and different. We have served pate, caviar and sorbet, so we can learn which utensils to use and experience new and different foods as well. I hope the information provided in our website will answer some of your etiquette questions. Janice HawkinsTroy University First Lady “Nothing is less important than which fork you use. Etiquette is the science of living. It is ethics. It is honor.” Etiquette is defined as the forms, manners, and ceremonies established by convention as acceptable or required in social relations, in a profession or in official life. Displaying a knowledge of proper etiquette helps make a wonderful first impression, whether in a business or personal setting. Also, having good manners makes you more confident of yourself in situations that may otherwise be more difficult to relax in. If your boss enters the room when you are meeting with an important client, how do you handle the introductions? You should introduce the more important person first. Address the client first and introduce your boss. You are entering a cab with an important business client. You position yourself so the client is seated curbside. Is this correct? Yes. When your client steps out of the cab, he or she will be on the curbside and not in the traffic or sliding across the seat. When you greet a visitor in your office, should you tell them where to sit? Yes. Indicating where your visitor should sit will make him or her more comfortable. You have an appointment to meet a business associate for a working lunch and you arrive a few minutes early to find a table. Thirty minutes later, your associate still has not arrived. What should you do?Order your lunch and eat. You have waited long enough. You should expect an apology from your associate later. You are greeting or saying good-bye to someone. When is the proper time to shake their hand? It is rarely improper to shake someone's hand. You are talking with a group of five people. With whom do you make eye contact? Try to make eye contact with each of the five, moving from person to person. Four ways to feel comfortable in a room full of strangers: Rules of introduction: When professional criticism comes your way, follow these guides to gain benefit: You are invited to a reception and invitation states ""6:00 to 8:00 pm."" When should you arrive?You may arrive exactly at 6:00, after 6:00, but not before. It is terribly impolite to arrive early. You are the host of a dinner party at a restaurant. Included are two other couples and your most valuable client and his wife. You instruct the waiter to: To serve your client's spouse first, and you and your spouse last. When is it proper to remove your napkin from the table, and what do you do with it when you are finished? Place your napkin on your lap after everyone at your table has been seated. When you are finished, place the napkin on the right side of your plate. When is it proper to begin eating?Begin eating after everyone at your table has been served. How should you hold your utensils? There are two acceptable ways to hold the knife and fork. The first way is continental style. The diner cuts the food usually one bite at a time and uses the fork in the left hand, tines pointing down to spear the food and bring it to the mouth. The second style is called American. Usually a few bites are cut, the knife is laid across the top of the plate, sharp edge toward you, and the fork is switched to the right hand, if right-handed, tines up to bring the food to the mouth. When you are dining out, if you have multiple utensils, how do you know what to choose? Start on the outside and work your way in. What do you do if you drop a piece of silverware? Pick it up if you can reach it and ask the server for a clean one. If you cannot reach it, tell the server you dropped a piece of your silverware and ask for a clean one. Should the salt and pepper be passed if only one was requested? Always pass the salt and pepper together. What is the correct way to eat soup? Always spoon the soup away from you then bring around to your mouth and back to the bowl. Think of making a circle. What is the correct way to eat rolls or bread? Eat rolls or bread by tearing off small bite size pieces and buttering only the piece you are preparing to eat. When you are ready for another piece, repeat the same process. The waiter is coming in your direction to serve wine. You do not want any. Your turn your glass upside down. Are you correct?No. Do not call attention to your dislike of your host's choice of beverage. Someone has proposed a toast in your honor. You say ""thank you"" and take a sip of your drink. Are you correct? No. If you do, then you are toasting yourself. When is it acceptable to place your elbows on the table? Only between courses, not while you are eating. If you need to leave the table during a meal, where do you place your napkin? Place your napkin on your chair as a signal to your server that you will be returning. There are many things to remember when dining. If you are with a perspective employer, remember it may look like lunch or dinner, but it is still business. The way you conduct yourself during a meal will have impact on an interviewer's hiring decision and on your future.

Course Information,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is a commissioning program designed to give college students the opportunity to train to become Air Force or Space Force officers while completing their undergraduate degree. The AFROTC program is designed to prepare men and women to assume positions of increasing responsibility and importance in the modern Air Force or Space Force. Air Force ROTC is a four-year program that can be condensed to three years, if necessary. Four-year Program – The General Military Course (GMC) is the first half of the four-year program, and students generally take these courses during their freshman and sophomore year at Troy University. This program allows students to ""try out"" AFROTC for up to two years without incurring any military obligation (EXCEPTION: scholarship students fall under different rules). As you attend class, you'll learn about the Air Force and the historical development of airpower in war. The last two years of AFROTC are called the Professional Officer Course (POC) and are required for all students qualified and wishing to seek commission. All POC cadets are contracted with the Air Force and obligated to serve active duty following graduation and commissioning. Your weekly requirements with AFROTC will amount to 5-6 hours of time at the Detachment. You can put as little or as much time into Air Force ROTC as you want beyond that, as long as you satisfy all academic, Leadership Laboratory, and physical fitness requirements. The ROTC staff knows your studies are critical for your success in college, your success in the ROTC program, and your success in the future. In order to enroll in AFROTC classes with Det 017, you must be a full-time student at Troy University. AFROTC cadets are required to take 24 credit hours of Aerospace Studies courses through AFROTC to prepare them for a commission in the USAF or USSF. These academic courses are accredited with Troy University and are taught by the officer Cadre on staff. These courses are in addition to the colleges' degree requirements for the student's specific Bachelor's degree. The following is a summary of the courses offered and the sequence that they must be taken: Freshman 2 Credit Hours Per Semester Department of the Air Force (DAF) Professionalism (AS 1112) Leadership Lab I (AS L112) Competition and Security(AS 1113) Leadership Lab II (AS L113) Sophomore 2 Credit Hours Per Semester Team and Leadership Fundamentals I (AS 2212) Leadership Lab I (AS L212) Team and Leadership Fundamentals II (AS 2213) Leadership Lab II (AS L213) Junior 4 Credit Hours Per Semester Leading People and Effective Communication I (AS 3312) Leadership Lab I (AS L312) Leading People and Effective Communication II (AS 3313) Leadership Lab II (AS L313) Senior 4 Credit Hours Per Semester National Security and Preparation for Active-Duty I(AS 4412) Leadership Lab I (AS L412) National Security and Preparation for Active-Duty II(AS 4413) Leadership Lab II (AS L413) This is a survey course designed to introduce student to the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC). Featured topics include mission and organization of the Air Force, Air Force Core Values, officership and professionalism, leadership principles, group leadership dynamics, military customs and courtesies, Air Force officer career opportunities, and an introduction to communication skills. This course is designed to examine the historical significance of air and space power. Students will explore the importance of early flight experiments, the introduction of air power in war, and the evolution of air doctrine to current operations. In addition, the students will continue to discuss the importance of the Air Force core values, through the use of operational examples and historical Air Force leaders. A study of leadership, management fundamentals, professional knowledge, Air Force personnel evaluation systems, leadership ethics, and the communication skills expected of Company Grade Officers (junior officers). Case studies are used to examine Air Force leadership and management situations as a means of demonstrating and exercising practical applications of the concepts studied. Examines the national security process, regional studies, advanced leadership ethics, and Air Force doctrine. Special topics of interest focus on the military as a profession, officership, military justice, civilian control of the military, preparation for active duty, and current issues affecting military professionalism. Continued emphasis is given to the refinement of communication skills. Leadership Lab is a cadet-run program taken each semester of cadet participation in AFROTC. POC, or upper class, cadets plan, manage, and execute LLAB activities each week. LLAB is a two-hour course that you will register for each semester with Troy University. It is a pass/fail course with the university and requires successful completion in order to move forward in the AFROTC program. In short, LLAB is the hands-on version of what you learn about in your Air Force class. All cadets are required to participate in Physical Training (PT). The PT schedule is subject to change each semester based on the needs of the Cadet Wing. PT attendance is currently required on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 0600-0700. PT is another opportunity for POC cadets (Juniors and Seniors) to lead. PT activities vary from day to day. Expect an exciting workout that will build up your strength and endurance in preparation for the Air Force PT test that is administered each semester. Workouts include cardiovascular circuits, ability group runs, athletic competitions by class, and cadet-lead workouts based on today's most effective fitness trends like P-90X®, Crossfit®, and the Insanity® Workout. If you are not in shape, get ready to get in shape! The PFA is administered by the Detachment Cadre once a semester. The AFROTC PFA is the same as the Air Force Physical Fitness Test administered to all active duty personnel. The PFA consists of the following assessments: All events are conducted on the same day; the body composition (height and weight measurement) will be conducted first in the detachment, followed by the one minute of push-ups, one minute of crunches, and finally the 1.5 mile run. A break of no more than five minutes is required between the push-ups, crunches and run. All physical events are conducted on the old track on-campus. The Air Force Officer Qualification Test (AFOQT) is a commissioning requirement for all cadets. It is a standardized test similar to the SAT with additional sections testing a student's knowledge of aviation and other flight-related knowledge. The AFOQT is typically administered in the cadet's first term, and each student will have two chances to pass the test (a third attempt is available if a waiver is warranted). This test is administered at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery AL. All AFROTC cadets must compete against cadets from around the country attend field training in the summer between their second and third year. Field training is AFROTC's version of ""basic training"", but Field Training will not just test a cadet's ability to perform under stress, it is meant to evaluate military discipline and Air Force leadership potential. This is a cadet's final evaluation in leadership, followership, and team building before they will be allowed to enter the Professional Officer Course. Field Training is four weeks long and takes place at Maxwell AFB, AL. Not every student will attend Field Training because of the limited number slots available; selection is merit-based.

Berwager grew up in a small town in north Alabama where she received an art scholarship to a junior college, but chose to study Business Administration at Birmingham-Southern College. She continued taking art classes throughout college, but didn’t think she could make a living as an artist and teaching was totally out of the question. Ten years after receiving her degree in business, she started her family and returned to school for a master’s degree in Art Education. Her media of choice at that time was large oil paintings of odd still life objects seen from her two-year-old son’s point of view. Dr. Berwager received her MA.E. degree in 1996 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and then taught PK-12 visual art classes for 17 years. She received her Ph.D. in 2013 in Educational Research from The University of Alabama with a desire to teach at the collegiate level. She began teaching Visual Arts and Arts Education classes at Troy University in 2013. Her most recent works are more mixed media, with a faith-based, historical perspective. She enjoys juxtaposing historical elements with contemporary ones and the pursuit of identity through the genealogy of material objects. kberwager@troy.eduPersonal website: www.kellyberwager.com M.F.A., at East Carolina UniversityProfessor of Art & Design Sara Dismukes is an Associate Professor of Design at Troy University, where she has been on the faculty since 2006. In addition to design work, she also maintains an active studio practice. Special research interests include traditional bookbinding and book design, as well as art making that combines digital and analog processes. She earned her BFA at Henderson State University and her MFA at East Carolina University. sdismukes@troy.edu M.F.A., Studio Art, School of the Art Institute of ChicagoAssistant Professor of Art Jonny Farrow (born 1969, Kentucky, USA) works across disciplines: primarily in sculpture, printmaking, painting, sound, and transmission art, researching the liminal, the uncanny, the electromagnetic, and the dubious origins of popular mythologies. Coming out of New York City’s lower east side D-I-Y music scene of the 90s taught Farrow to freely experiment in his work and to see his art practice as being both intuitively and narratively driven. This, he believes, is the influence of songwriting on his practice as he is just as likely to start with a material (a riff) as a narrative (lyrical) or conceptual idea. Recently he has been focusing on kinetic sculpture made from cast bronze, making objects that if not in motion, somehow suggest it. This motion always points to the body, sound, presence or absence, and intent. He has shown and presented work in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Vermont, Sweden, United Kingdom, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. He has had three solo shows since 2016 and multiple group exhibits in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere since 2014. From 2011-2016 he produced The Distract and Disable Program produced for Wave Farm and broadcast on WGXC 90.7 FM in Hudson, NY. His music and sound works have been released by Hello CD, Dive Records, free103point9, and Must Die Records. He was a founding member/songwriter in the 90's indie rock bands Philco Bendyx and The Sixes. And, he has performed with Moby on The Late Show with Conan O'Brien, as well as played his handbuilt oscillators with Quintron and the Weather Warlock. Along with an BA from Troy University, he also holds an MA in music from CCNY (CUNY), and an MFA in Studio Art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. www.jonnyfarrow.net http://distractanddisable.blogspot.com/ Ph.D. in Art History, University of Leeds (UK)Lecturer of Art & Design Dr. Kenyon Holder has taught art history at Troy University for eight years. Prior to her work at Troy, Dr. Holder completed her MA in Museum and Gallery Studies and her Ph.D. in Art History both at the University of Leeds (UK). Her research work focuses on the Wedgwood collection at the Birmingham Museum of Art and she is a frequent contributor at regional and national art conferences. She is particularly interested in the contextualization of material culture within domestic and institutional settings, narratives of collecting, and the distinctions made between the decorative and fine arts. kholder@troy.edu M.F.A., Pennsylvania State UniversityLecturer of Art & Design Beverly had worked as a graphic designer for twenty years before she and her husband relocated to southeast Alabama from Baltimore, MD. Her educational background is in fine art, receiving a BFA from the Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio and her MFA from the Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. Currently, she is bridging her professional graphic design experience with her skills as an artist through teaching foundations of art and design at Troy University. Her courses focus on traditional foundation concepts with the development of professional critical thinking in various media and techniques. In addition, Beverly is active in her arts community serving on the Board of Directors at the Wiregrass Museum of Art in Dothan. Her work has been exhibited throughout the United States in juried exhibitions, in solo and group shows. Beverly’s work is also part of several corporate collections and The Baltimore Museum of Art Prints and Drawings Collection. Taking an experimental and eclectic approach, Beverly’s art captures sensations, impressions and moments of thought, through the juxtaposition of a variety of elements, materials, colors, textures, and forms. In addition to her artistic pursuits, Beverly has been a Beekeeper for eight years. Traveling is a passion and she has been to eleven different countries including; India, China and Iceland. Beverly and her husband have three adult sons, one residing in Manhattan, the middle son in San Francisco and the youngest in Baltimore. Artist Statement: Many ideas and experiences influence the mixed media collages and assemblages Beverly currently creates. Experimenting with many different materials ranging from the use of found images and objects, to knick-knacks collected along the way, each piece tells its own story, depicting varied interests and thoughts. Combining an assortment of elements and materials reflects an eclectic nature and unique point of view on personal experiences. Reflecting on her process, Beverly states: “The rhythm, flux, and flow of daily life intrigues me. Juxtaposition of various elements to make a visual statement starts as I ponder something I’ve considered about our human condition and the world we move through each day.” bwleach@troy.eduPersonal Website: www.bevwestleach.comInstagram: bwleach BFA in Art Education and Fine ArtsMFA in Graphic Design & Visual Experience Thiffany Belda is a passionate designer, artist, and educator dedicated to crafting creative solutions, teaching, and making a positive impact.With a BFA in Art Education and Fine Arts and an MFA in Graphic Design & Visual Experience from The Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), Thiffany combines her academic achievements with rich professional and life experiences gained from living and working in Brazil, England, France, Canada, and the United States.

His research examines the blurred areas between art and journalism, individual and collective, and the impact of each on the other. Will’s first monograph documents the juke-joint Po’ Monkey’s Lounge which serves as a prism for examining cultural tourism and preservation and the complexities prevalent in both. It was published by University Press of Mississippi in October of 2019, and for this work Jacks was recognized by the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters for outstanding achievement in photography. In 2020 he completed an M.F.A. in Studio Art from the Maine College of Art, and in 2021 he competed his MA in Journalism from the University of Mississippi.

M.F.A., University of AlabamaAdjunct Professor of Art Duane Paxson received an MFA in sculpture and ceramics in 1984 from the University of Alabama. He has since been a studio artist and an adjunct instructor for more than 30 years. He has taught sculpture, ceramics, drawing, two- and three-dimensional design, and visual arts. He has, moreover, served as director of the Malone Gallery at Troy University and as Curator of the OCAF Art Center in Watkinsville, Georgia. His work has been reviewed in The Southern Quarterly, Sculpture, World Sculpture News, Number, Asian Art News and Art Papers. His work was also included in Arthur Williams’ Sculpture Reference and Beginning Sculpture, both from Davis Publications. As an artist/sculptor he has experience in painting, welding, casting, stone carving, ceramic sculpture, and jewelry. He integrates all these media into his own mixed media sculptures. Since the mid- 80s Paxson has produced seven major series, sometimes ongoing and often overlapping. His most recent work, moreover, reveals a perspicacious assessment of social interaction, in short, the human condition. He delves with wit and infectious humor into the perennial problem of evil, creating monumental hanging sculptures, which prod the viewer to a good-humored meditation on this vexing problem. The engaging visual drama of the welded steel and fiberglass configurations serves, moreover, only to enhance the artist's sober ponderings, albeit often laced with levity. In 2015, he received the SECAC Fellowship, resulting in a one-person exhibition titled Malelingue, at the Perspective Gallery at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. rpaxson@troy.edu Personal website: duanepaxson.com MFA, Academy of Art University (in-progress)Adjunct Professor of Design Aaron J. Washington is an award-winning creative designer and manager who loves great stories, comic books, and fettuccine alfredo. His wife and kids are his motivation in everything, aside from his passion for all things nerdy. Aaron can spend all day explaining why the Star Wars prequels are way better than the sequels (thanks to Lucasfilm Animation), why Avatar: The Last Airbender is the greatest cartoon in existence, and why some ad campaigns are better than others, all with the same vim and vigor. That's probably why large companies pay him money for what he does. https://aaronjwashington.com/work B.S., Samford UniversityAdjunct Professor of Design Audry is a Samford University graduate with a B.S. degree in graphic design.

M.F.A., Ohio UniversityAdjunct Professor of Design Andrew Stalder earned his M.F.A. in painting from Ohio University, and a B.A. in drawing and painting from the University of Dallas. Stalder currently lives in the Fort Worth, Texas area. When he is not teaching or making art, Stalder can be found whipping something up in the kitchen, exploring the outdoors, reading, or playing video games. Painting has been the primary artistic medium Stalder has communicated through for the past 30 years. Multiple solo exhibitions at Fort Worth Arts, a solo exhibition at the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, as well as being a finalist for The Hunting Prize in 2016 are highlights of his exhibition record. Stalder’s work is included in the permanent collections of the McKinney Performing Arts Center in McKinney, Texas and the Athens Historical Society in Athens, Ohio. His work is also permanently installed in Rock and Brews restaurants in Texas and California. Recently, Stalder has been experimenting with Ai generated art. The focus of this experimentation is not using Ai generated art as an end in itself, but rather, as another tool in the artist’s toolbox. As such, he is currently in the process of designing all the visual assets for a fictional video game in which futuristic pirates battle giant steampunk robots in a dystopian New York Harbor.

M.F.A., SCADAdjunct Professor of Design As far back as my early childhood, I've been an unconventional artist and thinker. While I've always loved to draw and paint, it was making art from things that shouldn't go together (only they DO), that gives me most enjoyment. Eventually woodworking, carving, sculpting...and teaching became my first vocation. It was while I was a high school technology teacher that I became introduced to the world of computer graphics...and creating weird things in a new manner. I taught animation and motion graphics at the high school level in the mid-90's... back when not many people knew you could go to school for that kind of stuff. When I found out that I could get an advanced degree in the field, I jumped at the chance. I received my Master of Fine Arts in Computer Art from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2001. At SCAD, I was asked to adjunct a couple of courses, where I realized that teaching was a passion equal to creating. My focus as an educator was to teach marketable skills to students, and align those skills with employer demands. I try to bring an industry focus to my teaching.

Institutional Review Board Types of Review,"Safety Alert Info for: Quick Links: 1) Exempt Status Protocols that may be exempt from review by the IRB. Note: Exempt status does not apply to research involving prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women, or human in vitro fertilization. The following types of research are normally approved as exempt from IRB review. Research projects eligible for exemption include the following: Obtain Application Form 2) Expedited Reviews Most protocols that involve no more than minimal risk and do not involve vulnerable populations of research participants (other than minors) and are not otherwise exempt from full IRB review (see below), may receive expedited review. This type of review necessitates that a subset of the full IRB, delegated this authority by the Chair, independently evaluates the protocol, and when all reviewers concur, the protocol is approved. When one or more of these IRB members cannot agree with approval of a protocol, the protocol is then referred to the full IRB for consideration at a convened meeting. The IRB Chair, the relevant College or Site Representative, a Community Professional Representative, and one additional member of the IRB will review each Expedited review proposal. IRB staff transmits substantively complete protocols to reviewers within 24 hours of their receipt. Estimated response time for Expedited proposals is five-seven working days after receipt of a substantively complete protocol. Research that involves no more than minimal risk and falls within one or more of the following categories (as outlined in 45 CFR 46.110 and listed below) can receive expedited review under most circumstances: Obtain Application Form 3) Full Reviews Protocols require review by the full IRB at a convened meeting unless they meet the criteria for Expedited review or Exemption. This means protocols that involve more than minimal risk to research participants or vulnerable populations of research participants (other than minors when the protocol qualifies for expedited review) are reviewed by the IRB at a convened meeting. IRB meetings are held monthly at a time and place that is subject to change from semester to semester. See Schedule of Meetings for current information. Protocols that necessitate review at a convened meeting must be received by the IRB Chair office two weeks prior to the meeting date. Protocols that are substantively complete are sent to IRB members within 24 hours of their receipt. Estimated response time for Full Review proposals is four to six weeks after receipt of a substantively complete protocol. Principal Investigators and Co-Principal Investigators may attend the IRB meeting to provide information to the members, but they may not be present during the final discussions and vote. IRB members may not participate in the review and approval process of their own protocols. Obtain Application Form 4) Other Reviews Other protocols where there is no immediate involvement of human participants, such as training grants or where the research protocol is not complete or the research instruments are yet to be developed, generally fall into a special category (""Indefinite Plans"") that are reviewed solely by the IRB Chair. Upon completion of review a letter advising to proceed with the funding request will be sent to the Principal Investigator. A copy of this letter is sent to the Office of Research and Grants. When funded a detailed protocol describing the research (including the informed consent process and research instruments) must be reviewed and approved by the IRB. Allow four to six weeks for this process.",https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/graduate-school/research/institutional-review-board/types-review.html
