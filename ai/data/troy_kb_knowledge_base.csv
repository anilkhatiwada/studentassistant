1098-T FAQ,"For detailed instructions on accessing your 1098-T form visit: How do I access my 1098-t tax form? When does the 1098-T become available? If you consented to receive your 1098-T form online, you will receive a notification email before January 31 st indicating that this form is available. If you did not consent to receive the form online, the 1098-T form will be mailed to the address on file with Troy University before January 31 st . Please note that if you did not consent before the cutoff period (typically the middle of January), you will not receive a notification email.  However, you may still access your 1098-T form online after you complete the online consent form.  You will still receive a mailed copy of the form if you did not consent before the cutoff period. What is a 1098-T? The University is required to provide this form to students and the Internal Revenue Service.  The 1098-T provides a total of payments received for qualified tuition and fees as well as scholarship and grant information to students and the Internal Revenue Service. It also informs the Internal Revenue Service that the recipient of the form may be eligible for education related tax benefits.  Please consult with your tax advisors to determine how your payments to the University affects your tax situation. How do I reset the password to access my 1098-T? You will need to visit https://www.tsc1099.com/login1098.aspx and click the Forgot Password link. You will then need to enter 10296 in the site id field, your TrojanPass username into the username field and click the Submit button. You will then be sent an email to your Troy University email address allowing you to change your password. I did not receive a 1098-T form. Why? Not all students will receive a 1098-T. Below are possible reasons you did not receive a 1098-T form. You only took courses for which no academic credit is offered (Continuing education courses are a common example of noncredit courses) You are a nonresident alien. Note: If you would still like a form as a nonresident alien you will need to request a form each year. You will also need to ensure you have a tax identification number on file with the University before requesting the form.  Once you have verified your tax identification number is on file you can request the form by entering a helpdesk request . What is the advantage of receiving my 1098-T electronically? You will be able to access your 1098-T earlier because it will not have to be mailed. Also, you can easily access it multiple times should it get misplaced. My 1098-T forms in the past have had amounts in box 2. Why does this year’s form have an amount in box 1 instead of box 2? In previous years, your 1098-T included a figure in Box 2 that represented the qualified tuition and related expenses (QTRE) we billed to your student account for the calendar (tax) year. Due to a change to institutional reporting requirements under federal law, beginning with tax year 2018, we will report in Box 1 the amount of QTRE you paid during the year. What is included in box 5? All scholarships, grants, and 3 rd party payments are included in box 5. Scholarships and grants generally include all payments received from third parties (excluding family members and loan proceeds).  This includes payments received from government and private entities such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, civic and religious organizations, and nonprofit entities. How do I get my forms for prior years? You retrieve the forms at https://www.tsc1099.com/login1098.aspx . This website has the forms back to 2011. You will simply need to change the year in the dropdown box of the screen to the year of the form you are wanting to view. Once you have the correct year selected click the view/print link. I paid more in the calendar year than what is reflected in box 1 of the form. Box 1 amounts are limited to the amount of qualified tuition and related expenses (QTRE) we billed to your student account for the calendar (tax) year. For example, payments towards spring courses that were pre-registered for during the previous year will not be reported. Also, payments for housing or meal plan charges are not reported.",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=70066

How do I become an independent student?,"Many students ask, “Why am I considered dependent, even when I live on my own, my parents don’t support me and do not claim me as a dependent on their tax returns?” The answer to this question is somewhat involved. Basically, to be considered independent by the government, you must be able to answer “YES” to at least ONE of the following questions: - Are you 24? - Are you married? - Are you a veteran of the US Armed Forces? - Do you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you? - Are you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training? - Are you or were you an emancipated minor as determined by a court in your state of legal residence? - Are you or were you in legal guardianship as determined by a court in your state of legal residence? - Are you an orphan or ward of the court? - Are you homeless which would be determined by a school district homeless liaison, director of an emergency shelter funded by HUD, or by a director of homeless youth basic center? - Are you a graduate or professional student? - Do you have legal dependents other that a spouse? If you can answer yes to any one of the above questions, then you are independent, and it is not necessary to provide your parent’s information on the FAFSA. If you cannot answer yes to any of the above questions then, you are dependent. Therefore, you must provide parental information on the FAFSA. Last, but not least: It is a common misconception that if you are not claimed as a dependent on your parents’ federal income tax return, then you can be considered independent for the purposes of financial aid. In fact, your status on your parents’ tax return has no bearing whatsoever on your dependency status for financial aid!",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=44532
How do I file an academic appeal?,"Submitting an Academic Appeal Faculty members have the authority to grade student work and to assign grades. These are academic judgments. A faculty member’s syllabus enumerates student academic performance expectations and consequences. Faculty members render academic judgments when a student’s academic performance violates established standards or fails to meet stated expectations. Academic judgments, made by faculty, are based on academic content, course requirements, and student performance. Students may not appeal grades based on allegations concerning the competence of a faculty member, the fairness of examinations, the difficulty of a course, or other matters of a purely academic nature. Grades for individual assignments and exams may not be appealed. While it is recognized that faculty hold the right and responsibility to grant a grade, a student who receives a course grade that he or she believes to be unwarranted for reasons other than those listed above may appeal that grade using these stated procedures. Step 1. Within the first four weeks of the start of the following term or semester in which the grade is received, the student shall have informally appealed the grade to the instructor. If that instructor is not teaching at Troy University during the term or semester following issuance of the grade, the student will make contact with the instructor through the department chair to informally appeal the grade. In the case of a course taught through the TROY Service Centers or TROY Online, students should contact their home campus to determine the person designated by the appropriate college dean to assist the students with their appeals. Step 2. If the issue is not resolved at this informal level and the student wishes to pursue the appeal, the student shall request in writing a meeting with the respective department chair. This request shall be addressed to the department chair and shall be received no later than the end of the fifth week of instruction for the term or semester following issuance of the grade. The request must summarize the student’s complaint and the student’s informal appeal to the instructor. In the case of a course taught through the TROY Service Centers or TROY Online, students should contact their home campus to determine the person designated by the appropriate college dean to assist the students with their appeals. Step 3. Within two weeks of receipt of the request, the department chair shall discuss the appeal with the student and with the instructor, separately or at the same time. If the department chair upholds the decision, the matter is closed. The decision is final. Step 4. If the department chair does not support the decision of the instructor, the matter shall be appealed within two weeks of the department chair’s decision to the designated associate dean or dean of the college. The department chair will forward the appeal package to the designated associate dean or dean. The designated associate dean or dean will empanel three full-time faculty colleagues from the department and/or discipline to review the matter. The decision of this panel shall be final and binding on all parties. More information about grade appeals can be found in the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate Academic Catalog or in the General Regulations section of the Graduate Academic Catalog .

Safe*Connect will allow the campus to comply with the first requirement by requiring users to authenticate with TrojanPass UserID (without the @troy.edu) and TrojanPass Password before allowing them to use wireless network services. When you authenticate, the system records which network address you were assigned and how long you used it. That combination of data allows the campus to associate questionable network behavior with a specific user account and the person to whom that account was issued. Your username and password are your keys to the network, don't share them with anyone. You are responsible for all acts performed using your account. If you are concerned that someone may be able to use your account change your password immediately. Safe*Connect can currently only enforce the configuration requirement on systems running the Microsoft Windows and Mac OSx operating systems. Client applications are being created for other operating systems. When those clients are available the campus will require their use too.

These types of programs are often collectively referred to as ""malware"". They can be installed onto a computer via an infected file, across a network, as an e-mail attachment, and may be hidden within a program downloaded from the Internet. Anti-Virus software may be thought of as the police within a computer system. It protects a system by identifying the software that doesn't belong and then removing it and throwing it in a jail cell where it cannot interact with other software. Troy University provides a copy of McAfee ENS to students residing on Troy Campus, which will be verified via TrojanPass. McAfee ENS requires Windows 8.x or Windows 10. If a student owns a computer that is not supported by McAfee ENS, it is the responsibility of the student to purchase anti-virus software that is compatible with one's system. Simply installing Anti-Virus software isn't enough. It must be constantly updated to provide protection against the latest malware threats. McAfee ENS automatically updates itself on a daily basis. The anti-virus software pre-packaged with a new computer system is often only a trial version that will expire and must be purchased in order to receive future updates. Please verify that your Anti-Virus software is registered and updated. Students who have Anti-Virus software installed but would like to install McAfee ENS, must first uninstall the Anti-Virus software, reboot the computer, and install McAfee ENS. If a student installs two Anti-Virus programs on the same computer it will slow the computer system down and may even cause the system to crash and/or not reboot. Prior to installing McAfee ENS any installed Anti-Virus software must first be uninstalled. Residential students must download the McAfee ENS package for the Troy Campus. To download the latest version of McAfee ENS a student must be registered, have a valid Troy University e-mail address and live on the Troy campus .

Subcribing to the University Calendar,"The university calendar system, Trumba, is used to manage and deliver several key calendars to our websites and mobile app. In addition to providing this information on our websites, university students, faculty and staff can also subscribe to individual calendars in order to sync these important dates to their desktop Outlook clients and mobile devices. The best method for subscribing to a calendar, in order to ensure that the information is available across all of your devices, is to add the calendar from within the Outlook web application. If you add it directly to your device, instead of via Outlook in a web browser, it will only appear on that device. You will only need to complete this process one time for each calendar. Any updates to the calendar will be automatically synched to your account. We recommend following these instructions on a desktop or a laptop, instead of a mobile device. Copy the Calendar’s Subscription Web Address Faculty and staff may prefer to subscribe to the Academic Calendar, instead of the main Troy University Events calendar. The main events calendar contains nearly all events available, which may be more information than most individuals will want to have in their calendars. The Academic Calendar also includes data from the Holidays and Administrative Leave calendar; subscribing to both is not necessary. Login to https://my.troy.edu/calendars using your TrojanPass ID and password. Select the link for the calendar’s web page that you would like to add. Next, on the calendar’s page select the “Subscribe” link in the upper-right area above the list of dates. This will open a pop-up window with a list of different ways to receive the calendar data. If it doesn’t open ensure that your browser isn’t blocking it. Then only select the “iCalendar Subscribe” option (you do not need to login to Trumba in order to access the calendar subscription). In the area that appears, right-click on the “webcal” address that you are provided and choose to copy the link. The option you need to select in order to copy the link may have different wording depending on the browser that you are using. Paste this link into a new text file, or an empty Word document, so you can copy it later for the next set of instructions. Add the Calendar Subscription Web Address to Outlook for the Web Login to Outlook at https://outlook.com/troy.edu . In the bottom left corner of the browser window you’ll see a row of icons. Select the one that will load your Outlook Calendars. To the right of the search bar and the “New” button, you should see the “Add calendar” link. Select this link to continue. From the drop-down list that appears, select “From Internet”. In the next window paste the Calendar subscription web address that you copied earlier into the “Link to the calendar” box. Next, add a label for the calendar in the “Calendar name”. For example, if it’s the Academic Calendar you can simply label it “Academic Calendar”. This is the calendar name that will appear on your devices. Select “Save” to save this calendar to your account At this point, you may logout and close the browser window. After a moment you should see the items from this calendar populate into your Outlook client and any devices that are connected to your Troy University Office 365 account that can display your calendars. These calendars are read-only. You will not have the ability to change or delete these items.

Teamwork and Office 365,"Teamwork and Office 365 Every team is different; there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to collaboration. Office 365 is designed to meet the unique needs of every team, empowering people to communicate, collaborate, and achieve more with purpose-built, integrated applications. When deciding which Office 365 apps and services to use, think about the work your organization does and the types of conversations your teams need to have. Teams , as the hub for teamwork, is where people - including people outside your organization - can actively connect and collaborate in real time to get things done. Have a conversation right where the work is happening, whether coauthoring a document, having a meeting, or working together in other apps and services. Teams is the place to have informal chats, iterate quickly on a project, work with team files, and collaborate on shared deliverables. Outlook for collaborating in the familiar environment of email and in a more formal, structured manner or when targeted and direct communication is required. SharePoint for sites, portals, intelligent content services, business process automation, and enterprise search. SharePoint keeps content at the center of teamwork, making all types of content easily shareable and accessible across teams. Tight integration with Outlook, Yammer, and Teams enables seamless content collaboration across conversation experiences. OneDrive for Business for storing files and sharing them with people that a user invites. Content that a user saves to OneDrive for Business is private until the user shares it with others, making it the best option for storing personal and draft documents that are not intended to be shared or not ready to be shared. Yammer to connect people across the organization. Drive company-wide initiatives, share best practices, and build communities around common topics of interest or areas of practice. Crowdsource ideas to foster open discussions with people across the company.

Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams,"This article describes some of the limits, specifications, and other requirements that apply to Teams. Teams and channels Teams and channels Feature Maximum limit Number of teams a user can create Subject to a 250 object limit¹ Number of teams a user can be a member of 1,000² Number of members in a team 25,000 6 Number of owners per team 100 Number of org-wide teams allowed in a tenant 5² Number of members in an org-wide team 10,000 Number of teams a global admin can create 500,000 Number of teams a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization can have 500,000³ Number of channels per team 200 (includes deleted channels) 4 Number of Private channels per team 30 (includes deleted channels) 4 Number of members in a Private channel 250 Maximum size of distribution list, security group or Office 365 group that can be imported in to a team 3,500 Maximum number of members in an Office 365 group that can be converted to a team 10,000 6 Channel conversation post size Approximately 28 KB per post 5 1 Any directory object in Azure Active Directory counts towards this limit. Global admins are exempt from this limit, as are apps calling Microsoft Graph using application permissions . 2 This limit includes archived teams. 3 To further increase the number of teams, you must contact Microsoft support and request further increase to the number of Azure Active Directory objects in your tenant. Increase is only made for real-life production scenarios. 4 Deleted channels can be restored within 30 days. During these 30 days, a deleted channel continues to be counted towards the 200 channel or 30 private channel per team limit. After 30 days, a deleted channel and its content are permanently deleted and the channel no longer counts towards the per team limit. 5 28 KB is an approximate limit because it includes the message itself (text, image links, etc.), @-mentions, number of connectors, and reactions. 6 Teams in GCC can accommodate 25,000 members but teams in GCCH/DoD can only accommodate 2,500 members. Further note that teams/channel mentions are blocked in teams with over 10,000 members. Messaging Chat Users who participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams must have an Exchange Online (cloud-based) mailbox for an admin to search chat conversations. That's because conversations that are part of the chat list are stored in the cloud-based mailboxes of the chat participants. If a chat participant doesn't have an Exchange Online mailbox, the admin won't be able to search or place a hold on chat conversations. For example, in an Exchange hybrid deployment, users with on-premises mailboxes might be able to participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams. However, in this case, content from these conversations isn't searchable and can't be placed on hold because the users don't have cloud-based mailboxes. (For more, see How Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact .) Teams chat works on a Microsoft Exchange backend, so Exchange messaging limits apply to the chat function within Teams. Chat Feature Maximum limit Number of people in a private chat 1 250 2 Number of people in a video or audio call from chat 20 Number of file attachments 3 10 Chat size Approximately 28 KB per post 4 1 If you have more than 20 people in a chat, the following chat features are turned off: Outlook automatic replies and Teams status messages; typing indicator; video and audio calling; sharing; read receipts. The ""Set Delivery Options"" button (!) is also removed when private group chats contain more than 20 members. 2 Only 200 members at a time can be added to a group chat. See this article for more information . 3 If the number of attachments exceeds this limit, you'll see an error message. 4 28 KB is an approximate limit because it includes the message itself (text, image links, etc.), @-mentions, and reactions. Emailing a channel If users want to send an email to a channel in Teams, they use the channel email address. When an email is part of a channel, anyone can reply to it to start a conversation. Here are some of the applicable limits for sending email to a channel. Emailing a channel Feature Maximum limit Message size 1 24 KB Number of file attachments 2 20 Size of each file attachment Less than 10 MB Number of inline images 2 50 1 If the message exceeds this limit, a preview message is generated and the user is asked to download and view the original email from the link provided. 2 If the number of attachments or images exceeds this limit, you'll see an error message. For more information, see Exchange Online limits . Note Message size, file attachments, and inline images limits are the same across all Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licenses. Emailing a channel is not available in Teams for Office GCC/GCCH/DOD organizations. Channel names Channel names can't contain the following characters or words: Channel names Type Example Characters ~ # % & * { } + / \ : < > ? | ' "" , .. Characters in these ranges 0 to 1F 80 to 9F Words forms, CON, CONIN$, CONOUT$, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1 to COM9, LPT1 to LPT9, desktop.ini, _vti_ Channel names also can't start with an underscore (_) or period (.), or end with a period (.). Meetings and calls Meetings and calls Feature Maximum limit Number of people in a meeting (can chat and call in) 1000, includes GCC, GCCH, and DoD, but not A1 (300). View-only allows for up to 20,000 listen-only participants to join a meeting in which the organizer has a license for E3/E5/A3/A5 SKU, as well as, Government (GCC, GCC High, DoD).

For more tips on hosting large meetings, please see Best practices for a large Teams meeting . Note Breakout rooms can only be created in meetings that have fewer than 300 attendees. In addition, creating breakout rooms in a meeting automatically limits the number of meeting attendees to 300. Advise your end-users to not initiate breakout rooms in meetings where they expect more than 300 participants.

The team will assess each request and work with you to determine options that may be available. Learn more . Presence in Outlook Teams presence in Outlook is supported on the Outlook 2013 desktop app and later. To learn more about presence in Teams, see User presence in Teams . Storage Each team in Microsoft Teams has a team site in SharePoint Online, and each channel in a team gets a folder within the default team site document library. Files shared within a conversation are automatically added to the document library, and permissions and file security options set in SharePoint are automatically reflected within Teams. Note Each private channel has its own SharePoint site (previously called ""site collection""). If you don't have SharePoint Online enabled in your tenant, Microsoft Teams users cannot always share files in teams. Users in private chat also cannot share files because OneDrive for Business (which is tied to the SharePoint license) is required for that functionality. By storing the files in the SharePoint Online document library and OneDrive for Business, all compliance rules configured at the tenant level will be followed. (For more, see How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams .) Because Teams runs on a SharePoint Online backend for file sharing, SharePoint limitations apply to the Files section within a Team. Here are the applicable storage limits for SharePoint Online.

More information about team types, including class teams, is available in Choose a team type to collaborate in Microsoft Teams .

Microsoft Teams Recordings: Auto-Expiration,"Manage the expiration of a meeting recording Microsoft will soon be adding auto-expiration of Teams recordings.  (This will only apply to new recordings that are created after the change has been made.  Recordings that already exist will not be affected.) If your recording has an expiration date, you'll see a message indicating that when the recording pops into the meeting chat after the meeting ends. Open the details pane to view or change the expiration date. There are a couple of different ways to get there: Click on the recording to open it in your browser. Once the browser page has opened, select in the upper right to open the details pane. Or, go to My files in your OneDrive or Sharepoint site and view as a list. Mouse over the recording in question, select Show actions (the three vertical dots to the right of the file name), and then choose Details . When the details pane is open, look for Expiration date . Here's where you'll see the date that's currently set. (Currently, the default expiration is set for 120 days from file creation) Open the drop-down to see your options for changing the date. Extend the recording's availability for a certain number of days, or pick a specific date on the calendar. You can also choose No expiration if you don't want it to be deleted. Notes: The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected No expiration , it won't expire. The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically. Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141657

Should I apply for aid even if I don’t think I would qualify?,"Yes.

Because the FAFSA is also used to find out if you qualify for federal loans. Applying for Federal Student Aid Programs Using the FAFSA is free, so there is no good excuse for not applying. Unfortunately the belief that their own family is not eligible stops many parents and students from applying early - resulting in a late application after families are requested to write a check for tuition.

What does a date have to do with my financial aid?,"Your enrollment status for financial aid eligibility is directly related to the number of credits for which you are enrolled at the end of the free drop/add period; this is also called the Census Date. The financial aid shown on your Award Notification is based on the assumption that you will be enrolled full-time. The aid you receive is based upon the number of credits for which you were enrolled at the end of the free drop/add period. Credits added after the Census Date - after the last day of free drop/add are not seen by the system; students should notify financial aid when classes are added after the Census Date. Federal and state regulations require that certain portions of your award be reduced if you are enrolled less than full-time. If you are enrolled for 6 credits or less after drop/add, your cost of education is reduced to reflect the fact that you pay part-time fees.

Also, see U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS formerly INS), a Bureau of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). You must possess a high school diploma or equivalent. You must be seeking a degree in an eligible program and making satisfactory progress toward that degree. Certification programs are not eligible for Federal Aid.

I was told I cannot receive an award letter because I do not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). I have a 3.0; how can I not be meeting academic standards?,"All financial aid applicants must meet our Standards of Satisfactory Progress to receive financial aid. The US Department of Education requires all institutions to set minimum standards which students must meet to receive financial aid. The standards for financial aid are different than those used by the Office of the Registrar; we must count all courses attempted (including all repeated courses, dropped courses, incomplete courses, and withdrawals); for example, if you took a course and received an ""F"" and retook the same course receiving an ""A"", the Registrar will determine you have a 4.0 (allowing the highest grade for the course to stand) but financial aid will consider you to have a 2.0 counting all credits completed and all credits attempted. You must meet a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for undergraduate and 3.0 for graduate students. You must have a pass rate of 67%; in the example provided, the student would have a 4.0 according to the Registrar, a 2.0 according to financial aid and a pass rate of 50%: 3 credits completed divided by 6 credits attempted. In this example, the student would not meet the pass rate standard and would have to submit an appeal with mitigating circumstances. Students may not receive financial aid after attempting 150% of the hours required to complete their degree. The academic records office according to the published standards in the University Bulletin establishes the length of each program. Courses, which transfer from another post-secondary institution, will reduce the time frame accordingly. Examples: (1) If your degree is a 120 hour degree: 120 x 150% = 180 hours maximum time frame. You are eligible for only the first 180 hours of attendance. (2) If you transfer and bring 70 hours credit into a 120 hour degree program: 120 x 150% = 180 – 70 = 110 hours maximum time allowed for degree funding. All students must meet all three parts of Satisfactory Academic Progress: GPA, Pass Rate, and Maximum Hours/Time Frame.

What is Student Aid Index (SAI)? (Formerly EFC),"Beginning with the 2024-2025 academic year, the Student Aid Index (SAI) will replace the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) – an important factor in the needs-analysist calculation of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®), the form used by colleges, states, and other scholarship providers to determine financial aid packages. The information you input of the FAFSA® about you and your family’s financial profile will determine your SAI. The index will equal the sum of your parent’s available income, your income and assets. Your family’s ability to contribute is determined by a federally approved need analysis system. The SAI formula must be applied to each family’s financial information, so we can’t tell you here whether you’ll be eligible for federal student aid or estimate how much aid you might receive. That’s why you need to apply – to find out!",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=156924
How is my aid determined?,"How federal aid eligibility is determined, and, by default, what is asked on the FAFSA® are set by Congress. Legislation passed in 2020 was aimed at simplifying the application process and brings about a number of changes in calculating aid eligibility beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. FAFSA® Changes There will be three more obvious changes that all families will experience when completing the new FAFSA®. Simplification: The FAFSA® will reduce in maximum questions from 108 questions to 46. And because the FAFSA® on the Web is dynamic, some students won't even be presented with all 46 questions. Recent FAFSA® filers saw some questions dropped, and others will no longer be asked due to the way that tax and income information is now gathered. Tax/Income Data: Previously, students, a student's spouse (when married), and parent(s) (when students are dependent) entered their tax information or used the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer tax data from the IRS to the FAFSA®(R). Beginning with 2024-25, all persons listing tax information on the FAFSA® will be required to use the IRS Direct Data Exchange (DDX) to share tax information or confirm non-filing status. DDX gives ease to the process and reduces questions to be answered. This change also requires the student, spouse, and all parents with tax data reported to get an FSA ID (if you don't each have one already). Student Aid Index (SAI): The FAFSA® previously calculated an Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). Now the FAFSA® will produce the Student Aid Index (SAI). This name more accurately describes a number used to determine aid eligibility within programs and compared to other students. Also, this number, unlike the EFC, can be negative with the minimum SAI being -1500. EFC becoming SAI is more than a name update. The calculation of the SAI differs from the EFC calculation of the past and makes the following changes that may change your aid eligibility: No benefit for having siblings in college: The FAFSA® previously divided the EFC proportionally based on the number of the household in college. The elimination of this ""sibling discount"" will be the biggest change in aid eligibility for some students. The SAI will not use the number in college as a factor in calculation of eligibility. The determination to no longer consider number in college was made by Congress and can only be changed by Congress. Automatic Pell Grants based on income and household size : Families making less than 175% and single parents making less than 225% of the federal poverty level will see their students receive a maximum Federal Pell Grant award. Minimum Pell Grants will be guaranteed to students from households below 275%, 325%, 350%, or 400% of the poverty level, depending on household structure. Pell awards between the maximum and minimum amounts will be determined by SAI. Larger Income Protection Allowances: The Income Protection Allowance (IPA) covers a family's basic living expenses and is excluded from SAI formulas. New, larger IPAs lower the amount of student or parent income considered to be available to pay for college. IPAs will increase by 20% for parents, up to about $2400 (35%) for most students, and up to about $6500 (60%) for students who are single parents. Inclusion of family farms or small businesses: When required, families will now report the value of their farms or businesses. While this inclusion continues to be debated in Congress, it will be required reporting for appropriate families on the 2024-25 FAFSA® and can influence the SAI.",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=44248

What is a Stafford Loan?,"A Stafford loan is a variable interest rate loan made to students based on financial need. There are two kinds of Stafford Loans: Subsidized and Unsubsidized. With a Subsidized Stafford loan, you are not responsible for the interest charged on the loan as long as you are in school as an at least half-time student. Instead, the government pays the interest for you while you are in school. Students receiving Unsubsidized Stafford loans are responsible for the interest charged on the loan while in school (the rate varies annually based on the prior year average T-Bill rates but will never exceed 8.25%). A student can choose to either pay the interest or capitalize it. Capitalization occurs on a periodic basis and compounds over time – meaning interest charged on the principal is added to the principal, and then interest is charged on the principal plus interest and so on. Beware! Capitalized interest can be very costly! It’s best to pay the interest if you can. Repayment of either type does not begin until six months after the student graduates or stops attending on an at least a half time basis (6 undergraduate hours or 4 graduate hours). It is recommended that students make an effort to pay down the interest on an annual basis.

However, the action taken for a drop after the end of free drop/add depends on whether Troy University adjusts your charges when you drop. If your charges do not change, then your financial aid does not change. While your financial aid may not change for that term, you may have a problem with future financial aid due to the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirement if you do not complete 67% of the courses attempted at Troy University. If you are granted an administrative drop so that charges are reversed when you drop, then your financial aid is adjusted according to the number of credits for which you are actually charged (if your charges are reversed due to the drop, then some of your financial aid may be reversed and you would be responsible for the difference). For further assistance, please contact a Financial Aid Counselor at 1-800-414-5756 or submit a helpdesk ticket at https://helpdesk.troy.edu .",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=44271
Why am I considered dependent?,"Many students ask, “Why am I considered dependent, even when I live on my own, my parents don’t support me and do not claim me as a dependent on their tax returns.” The answer to this question is somewhat involved. Basically, in order to be considered independent by the government, you must be able to answer “YES” to a least ONE of the following questions: Are you 24? Are you married? Are you a veteran of the US Armed Forces? Do you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you?  Are you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training? Are you or were you an emancipated minor as determined by a court in your state of legal residence? Are you or were you in legal guardianship as determined by a court in your state of legal residence? Are you an orphan or ward of the court? Are you homeless which would be determined by a school district homeless liaison, director of an emergency shelter funded by HUD, or by a director of homeless youth basic center? Are you a graduate or professional student? Do you have legal dependents other that a spouse? If you can answer yes to any one of the above questions, then you are independent and it is not necessary to provide your parent’s information on the FAFSA. If you cannot answer yes to any of the above questions then, you are dependent. Therefore, you must provide parental information on the FAFSA. Last, but not least: It is a common misconception that if you are not claimed as a dependent on your parents’ federal income tax return, then you can be considered independent for the purposes of financial aid. In fact, your status on your parents’ tax return has no bearing whatsoever on your dependency status for financial aid!",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=44251

How do I apply for a student loan?,"Most students these days find that they need to get some type of loan to help finance their education.

In about three to four weeks the school will receive information from the federal processing center which will determine what type of loan you will be able to receive. (Subsidized, Unsubsidized or both). At this point you should have received a letter from the financial aid office to let you know what other documentation will be needed to process your request for a loan. Once all the required documentation is received and verified, you will be sent an award letter to accept your loan. At this point you can cancel your loan or reduce the amount listed on the award letter and return this to the financial aid office.

What is the FAFSA® Submission Summary?,"The federal student aid application process requires the collection and processing of data necessary to determine a student’s eligibility to receive federal assistance. The process begins with an applicant submitting a FAFSA® form to the Department of Education. After the FAFSA® form is processed, the applicant receives a FAFSA ® Submission Summary (formerly a Student Aid Report) , which is a summary of the data provided on the FAFSA form. The applicant reviews the FAFSA ® Submission Summary for accuracy and if necessary, makes corrections or updates to the submitted FAFSA® data. The FAFSA® Submission Form is broken into four tabs: Eligibility Overview, FAFSA® Form Answers, School Information and Next Steps. On the Eligibility Overview tab, the student sees information about what federal student aid they may be eligible for, such as a Federal Pell Grant and Federal Direct Loans. They are also able to view the Student Aid Index. Any amounts of financial aid that display on this tab are estimates and are not guaranteed. On the FAFSA® Form Answers tab, the student sees the answers that they and, if applicable, their contributor(s) provided on their FAFSA® form. If any of the provided answers are incorrect, the student can choose to start a correction. On the School Information tab, the student sees information about the college(s) and/or career school(s) that they selected to send their FAFSA® information. The student can compare the graduation rate, retention rate, transfer rate, default rate, median debt upon completion, and average annual cost of their selected schools. On the Next Steps tab, the student sees comments that pertain to their FAFSA® form. Some comments may require the student to start a correction or send additional documentation to their school. Other comments may be informational and do not require any further action from the student. You may find your FAFSA® Submission Form by logging into your FSA account at studentaid.gov .

What can affect my transfer credit evaluation results?,"The University can accept undergraduate courses completed at regionally accredited institutions of higher learning. The University can accept ACE recommended credits for military or civilian workforce experiences as listed in the National Guide, National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS), AARTS, SMARTS, etc. Developmental or remedial courses do not transfer, with the exception of select remedial math courses that are posted for prerequisite purposes only. The credits will still not be used toward total degree hours. Technical and/or vocational courses do not transfer, unless taken as part of a regionally accredited associate's degree and deemed appropriate for transfer. Continuing education unit (CEU) courses do not transfer. Credits from institutions that operate on the quarter system will be converted to semester hours. This is done by multiplying the quarter credit hours by 2/3 or by dividing the number of quarter hours by 1.5. Quarter Hours Semester Hours 1 .6666 2 1.3333 3 2 4 2.6666 5 3.3333 Grades of Pass/Satisfactory at the undergraduate level are acceptable as long as the credit is equivalent to a C grade or better. Each college determines how courses will be applied to meet general education and program requirements. A course that is determined to full-fill a general education area at one institution may not be acceptable as a TROY general studies requirement. In addition, for a transfer course to be awarded as a TROY science course, it must have a laboratory component. Equivalent science courses without a verified lab component will be applied to the lecture course only until the lab can be verified. Credit from community colleges is generally considered to be lower level and is generally applicable only to freshman (1100 level) and sophomore (2200 level) requirements. Some select 3300 level awards are allowed as approved by the departments. Additional documentation may be required (e.g., course syllabi or descriptions) if further review of a course equivalency is desired. Once this course-by-course credit evaluation is completed, an academic program evaluation can be performed to determine exactly what a student's remaining courses will be for a declared major/program/minor combination. A student should check with his/her academic advisor on how to obtain an 'Official' Academic Program Evaluation, which is a separate process from the transfer credit evaluation.",https://helpdesk.troy.edu/TDClient/1924/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=40741

How is my GPA calculated?,"GPA Calculation Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated using the grade points earned for courses taken and the number of credit hours of the courses taken. Grade points for a course are calculated by multiplying the grade value earned (""A"" is 4.0, ""B"" is 3.0, ""C"" is 2.0, ""D"" is 1.0, and ""F"" is 0.0) by the credit hours for each course. For example, for a 3 credit hour course, the grade points are 12 points for an ""A"", 9 points for a ""B"", 6 points for a ""C"", 3 points for a ""D"", and 0 points for an ""F"". To calculate GPA, the sum of the grade points earned for all courses taken is divided by the total number of credit hours taken. For example: if you take 4 classes, each worth 3 credit hours, your calculation for two ""As"" (24 grade points) and two ""Cs"" (12 grade points) would follow: 12 credit hours divided into 36 grade points, making your GPA 3.0 or “B” average.

If a student is unable to complete all course grading requirements, the student may be eligible to request the assignment of an incomplete grade. An incomplete grade is not automatically assigned by the instructor, but must be requested by the student and approved by the instructor. The decision to approve or reject a student’s request for an incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor using the following criteria: Student submits a completed “ Petition for an Incomplete Grade ” form prior to assignment of a course grade. Student’s progress in the course is deemed satisfactory. Student is passing the course when the request is made. The circumstances that prevented the student’s completion of course requirements are beyond the student’s control, and adequate documentation is provided. Time limit for removal of incomplete grade Any student who receives an “I” must adhere to the deadlines set by the instructor for when required assignments must be received.

What should I do if a grade is incorrect?,"Incorrect Grades Faculty members have the authority to grade student work and to assign grades. These are academic judgments. A faculty member’s syllabus enumerates student academic performance expectations and consequences. Faculty members render academic judgments when a student’s academic performance violates established standards or fails to meet stated expectations. Academic judgments, made by faculty, are based on academic content, course requirements, and student performance. Students may not appeal grades based on allegations concerning the competence of a faculty member, the fairness of examinations, the difficulty of a course, or other matters of a purely academic nature. Grades for individual assignments and exams may not be appealed. While it is recognized that faculty hold the right and responsibility to grant a grade, a student who receives a course grade that he or she believes to be unwarranted for reasons other than those listed above may appeal that grade using these stated procedures. Step 1. Within the first four weeks of the start of the following term or semester in which the grade is received, the student shall have informally appealed the grade to the instructor. If that instructor is not teaching at Troy University during the term following issuance of the grade, the student will make contact with the instructor through the department chair to informally appeal the grade. In the case of a course taught through the TROY Service Centers or TROY Online, students should contact their home campus to determine the person designated by the appropriate college dean to assist the students with their appeals. Step 2. If the issue is not resolved at this informal level and the student wishes to pursue the appeal, the student shall request in writing a meeting with the respective department chair. This request shall be addressed to the department chair and shall be received no later than the end of the fifth week of instruction for the term or semester following issuance of the grade. The request must summarize the student’s complaint and the student’s informal appeal to the instructor. In the case of a course taught through the TROY Service Centers or TROY Online, students should contact their home campus to determine the person designated by the appropriate college dean to assist the students with their appeals. Step 3. Within two weeks of receipt of the request, the department chair shall discuss the appeal with the student and with the instructor, separately or at the same time. If the department chair upholds the decision, the matter is closed. The decision is final. Step 4. If the department chair does not support the decision of the instructor, the matter shall be appealed within two weeks of the department chair’s decision to the designated associate dean or dean of the college. The department chair will forward the appeal package to the designated associate dean or dean. The designated associate dean or dean will empanel three full-time faculty colleagues from the department and/or discipline to review the matter. The decision of this panel shall be final and binding on all parties. More information about grade appeals can be found in the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate Academic Catalog or in the General Regulations section of the Graduate Academic Catalog . To view all undergraduate and graduate academic catalogs that are available, please visit the Academic Catalogs web page. Note: Students may not use this procedure to appeal grades resulting from violations of academic honesty.

TROY Email: [External] Subject Line Tag,"Phishing is among the top security concerns for Information Technology. Personal identifiable information, the primary target of phishing attempts, falling into the wrong hands can cause both financial and reputation damage to the University, students and its employees. Phishing attacks are often launched by including malicious attachments or links in email. When recipients open these malicious attachments or click on the links, it can spark an attack. Most email scams begin with messages from an external email system. As part of the Troy University's effort to reduce phishing and other email scams, these external email messages will now receive an [External] tag in the message subject. [External] email tagging makes it as easy as possible for you to recognize phishing attempts wherever we can. Avoid becoming the next phishing victim The best defense to avoid being scammed is to be suspicious of any message asking for sensitive information. If the message seems off, it probably is. Trust your gut. Phishing attempts can be clever, but they’re easy to avoid if you know the signs. What is [External] tagging and how does it work Most email scams begin with messages from an non-TROY email (external) email system, when enabled these external email messages will now receive an [EXTERNAL] tag in the message subject. Many safe and legitimate email messages come from external email systems and the [EXTERNAL] tag does not mean the message is a scam or malicious, only that recipients should take caution and read carefully . All email originating from outside the university, except for approved services, will be tagged with this [EXTERNAL] message.   See sample below: Internal Message Subject Example: ""Datasheet Intergrating"" External Message Subject Example: "" [EXTERNAL] Datasheet Intergrating"" What should I do when I see an [External] Email? It’s important to note that an email message with this warning does not necessarily mean the email is malicious – only that the recipient should take caution before clicking any links or attachments included within the email. The [EXTERNAL] tag means you need to stop and think about this email: Is it from a sender you know? Were you expecting the email? Verify with your friend or co-worker over the phone if you are unsure or if the email seems a bit off. If there is a link in the message, Don’t click it!  Instead, hover over the link to verify legitimate, or manually enter the known good URL into your browser. Does the message make sense?
